CALABASAS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 14, 2017-- 

Ixia , a Keysight Business and leading provider of network test, visibility, and security solutions, today announced TradeVision, the first market data monitoring platform to deliver a unique combination of market feed health monitoring and advanced network visibility with preprogrammed support for hundreds of trading venues. TradeVision directly supports companies that assimilate real-time direct exchange market data including stock exchanges, investment banks, market data consolidators, and quantitative trading companies.

Rapid detection of degradation in data feed quality is a considerable issue for market participants who use or transport real-time market feeds. The need for high accuracy gap detection and robust feed channel health continues to increase as capital market networks intensify in speed and complexity.

TradeVision is a new platform that combines market feed data technology from Ixia 's TradeView products with the company's turnkey Vision ONE network packet broker to deliver gap detection, feed and channel health and statistics, high-precision timestamping, microburst detection, as well as tap aggregation and filtering from a single, easy to manage platform. Leveraging the Vision ONE platform allows multiple Ixia Vision network packet brokers to be managed from a single pane of glass to support large scale deployments.

"Trading volumes keep growing around the world, forcing IT teams to continually expand their data capacity. When it comes to market data, every single packet counts," stated Scott Register, Vice President of Product Management at Ixia. "TradeVision enables IT teams to consolidate their market feed monitoring infrastructure with network visibility management, consequently simplifying their network design while lowering costs."

TradeVision is a two-in-one platform that serves as a market feed health monitoring and advanced network visibility solution, offering a wide range of customer benefits, including: 


   -- Consolidation of market feed health monitoring and aggregation, filtering, 
      and network visibility simplifies network design and lowers cost 
 
   -- Native 40G port capacity allows easy migration to higher network speeds 
      without the need to re-cable 
 
   -- Broad support for third-party analysis tools with advanced features such 
      as microsecond packet time stamping, helping to ensure that third-party 
      trade analytics tools are highly aligned 
 
   -- Channel feed health data which can dramatically reduce fault isolation 
      and fix times from hours to minutes 
 
   -- Simple set-up and configuration with pre-programmed exchange feeds 
 
   -- Proactive planning features to help prevent market feed data outages due 
      to lack of capacity 
 
   -- Rapid detection of network congestion issues and automatic alerts 

Cary Wright, Vice President of Product Management at Endace, stated, "By combining TradeVision's powerful detection with the accurate trade data recording and playback of EndaceProbe Network recorders, operators have a uniquely powerful solution for monitoring market feeds and responding to issues before they impact business."
