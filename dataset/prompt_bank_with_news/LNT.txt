CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa, Dec. 19, 2017

CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa, Dec. 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Alliant Energy 's Iowa energy company will add more clean energy with the acquisition of the English Farms Wind Farm. The company finalized an agreement with developer Tradewind Energy for the 170-megawatt project, located in Poweshiek County in central Iowa.

"Wind energy is a win for Iowans," said Doug Kopp , president of Alliant Energy's Iowa energy company. "The benefits of this project help customers through reductions in emissions and fuel cost. It gives landowners lease payments to help on the farm and it helps communities through increased local tax revenue for schools and community services."

Alliant Energy will build and own English Farms Wind Farm, with major construction starting in 2018. This is one of several wind farms the company is building to deliver cost-competitive, clean energy to customers.

Alliant Energy received approval in 2016 to add up to 500 megawatts of wind energy in Iowa. The company has requested a similar wind expansion from the Iowa Utilities Board again in 2017. With these combined projects, customers will get more than one-third of their energy from wind by the end of 2020.

This overall wind expansion represents a roughly $1.8 billion investment and adds up to 1,000 megawatts of new wind generation in Iowa. Together, that's enough to power up to 430,000 Iowa homes a year.

"It has been extremely rewarding to work with Poweshiek County officials, landowners and community members," said Jeff Hammond, senior development manager for Tradewind Energy. "We are very proud to partner with Alliant Energy , which is contributing to the transformation of Iowa's electric power supply."
