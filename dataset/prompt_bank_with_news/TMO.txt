treat non-small cell lung cancer patients

   CARLSBAD, Calif., Oct. 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- As part of its ongoing 
commitment to increase the utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
in the clinic, Thermo Fisher Scientific  announced today it has expanded 
the development of its Oncomine Dx Target Test by entering into an 
agreement with Blueprint Medicines Corporation  to develop and 
commercialize the Oncomine Dx Target Test as a companion diagnostic 
(CDx) for BLU-667 to identify RET fusions in people with non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC). 
 
 
   Taken orally, BLU-667 is a potent and selective inhibitor of the kinase 
RET, including RET fusions and mutations, currently being evaluated by 
Blueprint Medicines in a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of 
patients with RET-driven NSCLC, thyroid cancer and other advanced solid 
tumors (NCT03037385). The CDx will complement efforts to drive 
enrollment to the trial. Once validation is complete, Thermo Fisher  will 
submit a supplemental premarket approval application to the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA)  to expand the clinical claims for its 
Oncomine Dx Target Test. 
 
 
   Under the terms of the agreement, Thermo Fisher  will also retain the 
rights to commercialize the test globally and will lead all necessary 
filings to seek clearance from regional regulatory agencies for the 
test. Expansion of the CDx is part of a strategic plan to develop one 
test for multiple therapies. Use of an approved multi-gene CDx to 
simultaneously screen patients for targeted therapies is a shift away 
from the conventional testing method of running several, 
single-biomarker analyses in sequence to identify tumor profiles. 
 
 
   Studies have shown that RET fusions and mutations are present in 
multiple cancers. In NSCLC, which accounts for 85 percent of all lung 
cancers in the United States,(1) RET fusions are believed to be key 
disease drivers in about 1-2 percent of patients. There are more than 
220,000 new cases of lung cancer each year in the U.S., and the disease 
leads to more deaths than colon, breast and prostate cancer combined, 
according to the American Cancer Society . 
 
 
   The agreement with Blueprint Medicines marks the second CDx development 
program Thermo Fisher  has signed this year to expand the Oncomine Dx 
Target Test, which received FDA  approval in June and its first positive 
coverage decision by Regence Blue Cross Blue Shield this month. In May, 
the company announced a similar agreement with Agios Pharmaceuticals  to 
expand the test's indication to include IDH1 mutations in 
cholangiocarcinoma, a rare form of cancer that affects the human bile 
duct system with a high unmet medical need. 
 
 
   "We are pleased to work with Blueprint Medicines and leverage the 
expandability of the FDA-approved Oncomine Dx Target Test to offer it as 
a companion diagnostic for BLU-667," said Joydeep Goswami, president of 
Clinical Next-Generation Sequencing and Oncology at Thermo Fisher 
Scientific . "It also helps us accelerate delivery on our commitment to 
bring NGS to mainstream clinical practice so that patients can start 
benefiting from targeted therapies more quickly."
