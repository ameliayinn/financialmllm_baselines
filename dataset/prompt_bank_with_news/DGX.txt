0821 ET - DuPont (DD) benefited as US farmers shifted more acres toward soybeans this spring, helping lift the chemical conglomerate's agriculture earnings 11% to $963M. It's an encouraging sign for seed companies, which often have relied heavily on corn seed sales to generate the bulk of their sales and profits. But DuPont also notes an overall 1% decline in seed prices, which some analysts saw reflecting intense competition among seed suppliers as a slump in the US agricultural sector continues. Volume growth drove much of DuPont 's growth, along with increased insecticide and fungicide sales in North America. DD gains 1.1% premarket. (jacob.bunge@wsj.com; @jacobbunge)

0807 ET - United Technologies (UTX) Pratt & Whitney division helped drive 2Q with 6% organic sales growth. The focus is on its new geared turbofan jet engine, or GTF. CFO Akhil Johri feels good about producing 350-400 this year after building 145 in the first half, with 134 delivered. UTX made 138 for all of 2016. Supply chain issues in previous years that initially hurt production are in the past, Johri said, and the ongoing fix for durability problems with two parts should be completely fixed in the second half. As far as future issues, the engine has about 250,000 hours of flying time so is still breaking in. "The reality is that when you hit a million flight hours then you can feel you have a lot of the kinks behind you," Johri said in an interview. UTX gains 1% premarket.

0755 ET - General Motors (GM) Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens says the company's core North American market performance slipped by about $200M vs. 2Q 2016, but margins remain a very healthy 12.2% due to trucks and SUVs. Stevens said the company continues to aim to top 10% margins in North America in 2017. The decline in the second quarter relates to volume declines, which are somewhat driven by a pullback in sales to daily rental sales and an industry downturn in demand for passenger cars, such as SUVs.

0751 ET - United Technologies (UTX) beat Street expectations for 2Q top and bottom line and boosted its full-year outlook on both. The industrial conglomerate tends to be conservative with guidance, CFO Akhil Johri says, with the outlook boost coming from the first half performance rather than any shift in second-half views. Aerospace was the only division to see sales drop slightly driven by decline in providing parts to commercial aircraft makers, including landing gear for Boeing 777, and wide body jet production slowed. UTX expects the division to pick up in the second half as narrow body jet growth accelerates. For its Otis division, the focus continues to be uncertainty in China where UTX gained market share but had a slower conversion of backlog into sales. (thomas.gryta@wsj.com; @tgryta)
