1005 ET - Democrat Doug Jones' victory in Alabama could make it more difficult for Republicans to push through tax reform, analysts at B. Riley say. Once sworn in, Jones will reduce the GOP's Senate majority from 52-48 to 51-49, narrowing the margin of votes Republican lawmakers can afford to lose to push through a tax bill. "Our base case is that GOP leadership will do what it takes to get a deal done in any form before Jones is officially sworn in," say the analysts, adding that they believe there is still a 75% probability of the tax bill becoming law. A corporate tax cut could lift S&P 500 earnings and lend additional fuel to a long stock rally, while failure to push through legislation could send stocks and bond yields lower, investors and analysts say.

0948 ET - The Oasis Petroleum deal this week to issue equity and expand into the Permian Basin highlights investor concerns about the company's primary operating area in North Dakota, according to Tudor Pickering. Companies drilling in that region may have only six years left of well locations that can provide a 30% rate of return at an oil price of $50 a barrel, according to Tudor Pickering analysis. The positions of Continental Resources and WPX Energy can be extended through 2025, but Whiting Petroleum and Oasis could be depleted by 2022 or 2023, Tudor Pickering said.

0940 ET - Oasis Petroleum , a shale company that operates primarily in North Dakota, has fallen more than 17% since Monday after announcing a deal to issue equity in order to purchase acreage in the Permian basin. The price tag of about $40,000 an acre was not unusual last year, when many companies made similar transactions that investors welcomed as smart steps into one of the hottest regions in global oil. Shareholders were less enthused by the Oasis deal, although some analysts believe the quality of the acreage will be enough to make the transaction worthwhile, according to Tudor Pickering.

0931 ET - Honeywell didn't include any tax system changes into its 2018 outlook but will update investors as details develop, it said on a conference call Wednesday. Most of its cash is overseas with repatriation costs expected to exceed $1B, which it would pay over an 8 year period. Since the tax needs to be paid anyhow, there is less friction against using the cash hoard in the US. Tax changes would require a cost adjustment to Honeywell 's annual deal modeling, but it downplayed any benefit because other companies will also get the boost. (thomas.gryta@honeywell.com; @tgryta)

0918 ET - The Democrat's win in the Alabama Senate race boosts the likelihood of a government shutdown and an extended temporary budget, says Byron Callan at Capital Alpha, though the fallout on defense contractors would be limited. Contract activity is light around the holidays, with many plants shutting down for the break. Callan says problems begin to emerge for the sector if there's no deal by late January, as spending would remain frozen and new programs are barred from starting. That could lead to a rash of calls for exemptions, as witnessed last year on programs such as the Columbia missile sub being built by General Dynamics . Fellow shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls higher in pre-open trade following a series of insider share purchases reported Tuesday. (doug.cameron@wsj.com; @dougcameron)

0914 ET - Plains All American announced an open season on its proposed pipeline project to take to Corpus Christi from the Permian Basin. The company said it had received sufficient interest to begin a binding open season with customers. The announcement comes just days after Phillips 66 and Enbridge announced open season for the Gray Oak Pipeline, another proposed line to take oil out of the Permian, the epicenter of US oil drilling. The plains project will combine existing lines with two new ones to get carry 575,000 barrels per day to Corpus where it can be used by refiners or exported from access to the Gulf of Mexico.

0906 ET - Daily freight rates for capesize vessels, the industry's biggest general cargo carriers, broke the $30,000 mark this week, the highest in four years. "There is strong demand from China for coal and iron ore, with previously shelved infrastructure projects coming back into play," a Singapore broker said. New cape deliveries in 2018 will be limited, meaning freight rates may cross $40,000 in the first half of the year, well above the $25,000 average breakeven point. (costas.paris@wsj.com)

0854 ET - After rising overnight, Treasury bond yields reversed course early Wednesday, falling after data show some weakness in inflation. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note was recently at 2.381%, according to Tradeweb , compared with 2.403% Tuesday. The consumer-price index rose 0.4% in November, in line with what economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal had expected. But core prices, which exclude the more volatile categories of food and energy, rose just 0.1% in November, missing economists' estimates for a 0.2% increase. "The lack of robustness of inflation data very much brings the continued hawkishness of the Fed into question," says Aaron Kohli interest-rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets .

0852 ET - The cost of seeing a physician in the US fell by a record amount over the past year. Physician prices declined 1.8% in the 12 months through November, according to the Labor Department's consumer-price index. The annual drop is the biggest since record keeping began in 1947. The trend continued in November, with prices falling 0.8% from a month earlier. (joshua.mitchell@wjs.com; @JMitchellWSJ)

0837 ET - A modest pickup in consumer prices is likely to reassure the Fed as it prepares to raise interest rates Wednesday, though underlying inflation remains sluggish. The consumer price index rose 0.4% in November from a month earlier, pushing the annual inflation rate up to 2.2%. The biggest driver was higher energy prices, which rose 3.9% over the month and accounted for about three-quarters of the overall consumer-price increase. Core prices climbed 0.1% in November from October and 1.7% over the year. That suggests the puzzle of weak inflation despite low unemployment remains unresolved.

0833 ET - William Hill is the best placed among U.K. betting companies to benefit from a potential deregulation of the U.S. sports-betting market, says Numis. The brokerage says the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments in favor of licensing sports gambling, which is currently prohibited in many states. Numis says the illegal gambling market in the U.S. is estimated at $200 billion, and William Hill has the most established sports-betting operation in the U.S. among U.K. companies.
