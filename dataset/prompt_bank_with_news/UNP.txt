OMAHA, Neb., Aug. 31, 2020

OMAHA, Neb., Aug. 31, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP; and "Union Pacific " or the "Corporation") today announced the pricing terms of its private offers to exchange certain of its outstanding notes and debentures referenced in the table below (the "Existing Notes") for a combination of new notes due 2062 (the "New Notes") and cash (the "Exchange Offers"), established as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on August 31, 2020 (the "Price Determination Date") in accordance with Union Pacific 's offering memorandum dated August 17, 2020 (the "Offering Memorandum") and the related letter of transmittal.

The total exchange price to be received in each Exchange Offer (the "Total Exchange Price") for each $1,000 principal amount of Existing Notes validly tendered, not validly withdrawn prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 28, 2020 (the "Early Exchange Date") and accepted for exchange is set forth in the table below. The Total Exchange Price, which includes the early exchange premium of $50.00 in cash per $1,000 principal amount of Existing Notes validly tendered, not validly withdrawn prior to the Early Exchange Date and accepted for exchange, will be paid via the issuance of the principal amount of New Notes set forth in the table below, with the remaining amount paid in cash. The Total Exchange Price has been determined using the yields for the Exchange Offers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Offering Memorandum. Holders of Existing Notes who validly tender Existing Notes after the Early Exchange Date that are accepted for exchange will receive the Total Exchange Price less the early exchange premium of $50.00 in cash per $1,000 principal amount of Existing Notes validly tendered, not validly withdrawn and accepted for exchange. The annual interest rate on the New Notes will be 2.973%, which has been determined as the bid-side yield of the designated reference security as of the Price Determination Date, which was 1.493%, plus the applicable spread.

The table below shows the Total Exchange Price per $1,000 principal amount of each series of Existing Notes accepted in the Exchange Offers.

The Exchange Offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on September 14, 2020, unless extended or earlier terminated by Union Pacific (the "Expiration Date"). In addition to the consideration described above, all eligible holders of Existing Notes validly tendered, not validly withdrawn and accepted for exchange prior to the Expiration Date will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on those Existing Notes from the last interest payment date to, but not including, the settlement date of the applicable Exchange Offer, which is expected to be September 16, 2020, the second business day after the Expiration Date.

The Exchange Offers are being conducted upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offering Memorandum and the related letter of transmittal.
