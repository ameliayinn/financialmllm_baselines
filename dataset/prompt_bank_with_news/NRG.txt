The changing American electricity landscape is pressuring power companies to shed unprofitable plants and reshape their portfolios to favor the new winners. Texas is an example.

Citing low gas prices and the proliferation of renewables such as wind and solar, Vistra Energy Corp., a vestige of the former Energy Future Holdings Corp., said it would retire three coal-fired facilities in Texas by early next year and that it plans to merge with independent power producer Dynegy Inc.

Exelon Corp., the country's largest owner of nuclear power plants, placed its Texas subsidiary under bankruptcy protection in November, saying "historically low power prices within Texas have created challenging market conditions for all power generators."

The average wholesale power price was less than $25 per megawatt hour last year on the grid that coordinates electricity distribution across most of Texas, according to the operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or Ercot. A decade ago, it was $55.

Prices have fallen a similar amount on PJM Interconnection, the power grid that serves some or all of 13 states, including Pennsylvania and Ohio. A megawatt hour there traded for $29.23 last year, the lowest level since 1999, which is as far back as the grid's independent market monitor tracks prices.

The falling prices have been felt primarily by wholesale generation companies, who sell their power to utilities, and generally haven't trickled down to businesses and homeowners. But the lower prices have allowed many utilities to avoid raising customer rates while making substantial investments in modernizing aging electric transmission networks.

The price drop on PJM reflects the construction of dozens of new gas-burning power plants, spurred by the abundance of the fuel due to the shale drilling boom. In 2006, 8% of the electricity on PJM was generated by natural gas. In 2016, it was 27%.

Weak demand for electricity also has played a role, as Americans purchase more energy-efficient appliances and companies shave power use to cut costs. Last year, power demand on PJM grew a mere 0.3% after falling the two previous years.

The resulting market reality -- more power available to buyers of roughly the same number of megawatts -- has most-acutely impacted older coal and nuclear plants, which are struggling to provide competitively priced power. It has even begun to affect older natural-gas-fired facilities that have higher costs.

"Generators are just fighting for existing market share," said Ari Peskoe, a senior fellow in electricity law at Harvard Law School. "The aging fleet of coal and nuke generators, combined with low prices, makes this intense."

FirstEnergy Corp., an Akron, Ohio-based utility, said late last year it was exiting competitive power markets. It is selling four natural-gas plants and hopes to sell coal and nuclear plants that provide power in the PJM wholesale marketplace.

This summer, power company NRG Energy Inc. announced a transformation plan that included selling up to $4 billion in power generation.

West of the Mississippi River, power markets also have been upended by the rapid growth of wind, as the cost of generating power from wind turbines is falling. In 2016, all of the new generation built in the Southwest Power Pool, a grid that covers an area from Louisiana to Montana, was wind, gas and solar. The vast majority of the retirements were coal and nuclear plants.

Wind is the fastest-growing source of power on Texas' grid. Last year, wind generated 15% of the electricity in Ercot, more than nuclear power, which accounted for 12%. By 2019, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin's Energy Institute expect wind to surpass coal as Ercot's second-largest source of electricity.

"Solar and wind are now competitive with natural gas-fired generation," said Curt Morgan, Vistra's chief executive. Mr. Morgan said that while he thinks natural gas will be the "workhorse" of U.S. electricity markets for at least the next decade, in Texas "I think it's going to be a while before you see another gas plant built in Ercot."

Last week, Siemens AG said it was cutting 6,900 jobs, in large part because it has overestimated demand for its giant power turbines.

The changes have been felt primarily in competitive power markets, which exist in many parts of the U.S., including California, Texas and the Midwest. In those areas, wholesale electricity is sold through daily auctions that favor the least-expensive sources of power, and it is then purchased by utilities and others.

Some regions of the U.S. don't have competitive power markets, and instead power is generated entirely by utilities and sold to customers at rates regulated by state officials. Even in regulated markets, changes are afoot. Earlier this week, WEC Energy Group Inc. said it was closing its Pleasant Prairie coal plant in Wisconsin, citing a desire to add more gas and solar generation.

As companies face price pressures, some have sought government aid. Exelon has been pushing states to create new subsidies for them.

The Trump administration is aiming to provide a lifeline to the coal and nuclear industries through several proposals, including a plan to assist power plants that provide constant, baseload power to ensure energy security.

But that proposal, which has to be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, has been criticized as anticompetitive and unlikely to reverse market trends.

An analysis by investment bank Lazard shows that on an unsubsidized basis and over the lifetime of a facility in North America, it costs about $60 to generate a megawatt hour of electricity using a combined-cycle natural-gas plant, compared with $102 burning coal and nearly $150 using nuclear. By that criteria, Lazard estimates electricity from utility-scale solar and wind facilities is even cheaper than gas.

A megawatt hour of electricity from utility-scale crystalline solar comes in at $49.50 and wind at $45. That metric carries a caveat, however: It doesn't factor in that wind and solar are more intermittent producers of power than conventional generation sources, as the sun doesn't always shine and the wind doesn't always blow.

Chris Moser, senior vice president of operations at NRG, said the challenge in many parts of the U.S. now is to ensure a diverse mix of power resources so that if one encounters issues, others can fill in.
