1307 ET - Walgreens (WBA) won't get the Rite Aid (RAD) tie-up that it wanted, but it is getting a discount on the thousands of RAD drug stores it hopes to buy. The initial $9.4B deal had Walgreens (WBA) paying roughly $2.6M per store once the two companies offloaded 865 locations to a regional chain. The deal announced Thursday has WBA paying $2.4M per store. (sharon.terlep@wsj.com)

1250 ET - Sycamore Partners is pulling a page from its own playbook in its plans for Staples (SPLS), which it agreed to buy yesterday. The private-equity firm plans to split SPLS into three separately financed entities, The Journal reported on Thursday. When Sycamore bought beleaguered retailer Jones Group in 2014, it split the company into six separately financed entities which made it easier to facilitate the sales of two of them: Kurt Geiger and Stuart Weitzman. SPLS shares are up 1.8% to $10.11. (dana.mattioli@wsj.com; @DanaMattioli)

1244 ET - Whole Foods Market (WFM) drops to the $42 offer Amazon.com (AMZN) made to buy the grocer two weeks ago on more skepticism that other bidders will emerge. Oppenheimer downgraded WFM Thursday to perform from outperform on expectations fading over another bidder. The stock had closed as high as $43.26 on June 21. Oppenheimer was among those that said another bid could materialize. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)

1241 ET - Major indexes hit session lows, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average shedding 166 points, or 0.8%, to 21289, the S&P 500 off 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite down 1.6%. A big weight on major indexes today: declines in tech stocks. The group, down 1.8% in the S&P 500 and resuming a recent spurt of weakness, is offsetting gains in financial shares, which rallied earlier after the Federal Reserve approved bigger dividend payouts and share buybacks. With financials now paring those gains, there's not much else padding major indexes. (akane.otani@wsj.com; @akaneotani)

1229 ET - Societe Generale cuts its oil price forecasts as it sees a slower-than-expected market rebalancing. Rising US production, as well as output from OPEC members Libya and Nigeria that are exempt from production caps, have added to the bearish sentiment on the market. The bank sees Brent averaging $50 in 3Q (revised down by $7.50) and $52.50 in 4Q (-$7.50). On an annual average basis, Brent is forecast at $52 for 2017 (-$4.40) and $54 for 2018 (-$6). Brent now trading at $47.80. (georgi.kantchev@wsj.com; @georgikantchev)

1222 ET - PacifiCorp, an Oregon-based utility owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Energy, says it is asking for approval to expand wind power in Wyoming, Utah and Idaho. Berkshire Hathaway Energy previously announced plans to spend $13.6B from 2017 to 2019, primarily in wind and solar investments through PacifiCorp and its other utilities. PacifiCorp plans to complete these projects by 2020 to take advantage of federal tax credits. (nicole.friedman@wsj.com; @NicoleFriedman)

1218 ET - Industrial metals continue to rise -- copper's up 0.96% at $5,935.50 a ton and aluminum is up 0.95% at $1,914.00 a ton. Recent gains are being consolidated by the continued slump in the dollar. The WSJ Dollar Index -- which measures USD against a basket of other currencies -- is down 0.22% at 87.81, and off 1.17% on the week. "That's fuelling optimism and short-covering across the complex," FastMarkets's William Adams says. Recent drawdown of global copper supplies is tightening the market, Adams adds. Tin has jumped 2.75% to $19,970 a ton, rallying after negativity stemming from expectations that China will soon start ramping up overseas refined tin (as opposed to tin products).

1214 ET - Constellation Brands (STZ) CEO Rob Sands says Ballast Point, the craft-beer maker his company acquired for a record $1B in 2015, "has not performed to expectations from a growth standpoint." STZ recorded an $87M non-cash impairment charge to the trademark value of the Ballast Point brands for F1Q. "We remain committed to achieving our targeted return on investment," Sands says, calling Ballast Point "an important part of our high-end strategy." He notes distribution gains and an investment in Ballast Point's first consumer marketing campaign. (jennifer.maloney@wsj.com; @maloneyfiles)

1209 ET - Lost in the mess of Staples' (SPLS) breakup into three separately financed units is an unlikely beneficiary: competitor Office Depot (ODP). Both chains face withering in-store sales, but their merger attempt last year ended amid fears over higher prices for business-to-business deliveries, not in retail. A clean break could let bankers glue together SPLS and ODP's retail operations, removing at least one competitor on the strip-mall scene. But much would have to align before that could happen, and time isn't on either chain's side. (andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com; @drewfitzgerald)

1153 ET - Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) isn't sweating the threat of Amazon (AMZN) on its turf. Asked about the prospect of Amazon getting into the pharmacy market (it hired a manager to develop a pharmacy strategy), Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said he thinks it unlikely. "They have so many opportunities around the world and in many other categories, which are much, much simpler than health care, which is a very regulated business," he said. "So as they are a very good team and very rational team, I believe that in the end, this will not be their priority." (sharon.terlep@wsj.com)
