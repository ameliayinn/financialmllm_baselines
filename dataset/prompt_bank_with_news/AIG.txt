0813 ET - The dollar's 2017 slide has been a boon to companies whose businesses are focused outside the US. Goldman Sachs ' basket of stocks of firms with the most international sales has risen 18% this year, versus the 7% gain of US firms with high domestic sales. The moves represent a reversal of the period between Election Day and the end of 2016, when hopes for stronger economic growth under the Trump administration boosted the dollar and shares of small-capitalization companies. Softer economic data has since led to an unwinding of that trade, although GS sees the dollar strengthening by about 7% over the next 12 months relative to the yen, the pound and the yuan.

0757 ET - Glu Mobile (GLUU) raised its full-year guidance following a strong 2Q it said was driven largely by "Design Home," a casual mobile game the company inherited in December through an acquisition. With a Taylor Swift game and new zombie shooter slated for launch later this year, management said it now projects bookings of between $307M-$312M, up from $280M-$290M. "Glu has enjoyed a strong start to 2017, but we think that it is more prudent to remain on the sidelines at present," said Wedbush in a note in which it raised its price target for the company to $2.90 from $2.80. "The increases to guidance seen this year so far could prove too bullish should Design Home's popularity diminish." (sarah.needleman@wsj.com; @saraheneedleman)

0753 ET - Cardinal Health (CAH) reports profit growth in its fiscal 4Q, as stronger market positioning, scale growth and added long-term drivers outweigh turbulence in the healthcare industry. One of those long-term growth drivers is the acquisition of Medtronic 's patient recovery business for $6.1B. Revenue for both business units also sees growth in the quarter, but pharmaceuticals' swing to a loss primarily on generic pharmaceutical pricing.

0739 ET - Contractor KBR 2Q revenue edge up to $1.1B, just shy of expectations. Though revenue from government contracts, its largest segment, increased due to acquisitions and increased orders, profit slid a bit. Of more concern is KBR 's engineering and consulting segment, where revenues dropped by $159M. CEO Stuart Bradie says KBR is bolstering its engineering and consulting business by focusing on winning smaller, more reliable contracts over large ones. The company is betting it will work, raising its 2017 EPS guidance to $1.25 to $1.45 a share. Shares in KBR , down 11% this year, are inactive premarket. (cara.lombardo@wsj.com; @CaraRLombardo)

0640 ET - Bunge (BG) 2Q earnings fall short of expectations after the company said last month that didn't expect to meet analyst earnings expectations of a more moderate fall. BG's agribusiness was weighted by slow farmer selling in South America and weak margins. The company said, "we are optimistic about a much better second half of the year," but that the soybean crushing industry oversupplied the market in 2Q, and 3Q margins are expected to take the toll.

0248 ET - In the last 10 sessions, the S&P 500 has closed within a miniscule 8-point range--2469.91 to 2477.83. That coil is about to unwind today amid Apple's (AAPL) F3Q report. Shares of the world's biggest company by market cap jumped 4% following its beat, which will single-handedly give the index a boost, never mind the broader tech gains the report generated in Asia--and likely elsewhere as the global trading day rolls on. The index finished Tuesday at 2476.35 and S&P futures are up 0.1% in early European trading. (kevin.kingsbury@wsj.com; @kevinkingsbury)
