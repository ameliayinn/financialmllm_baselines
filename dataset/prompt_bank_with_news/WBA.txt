   ST. LOUIS, Oct. 2, 2017 
 
 
   ST. LOUIS, Oct. 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Express Scripts  (NASDAQ: ESRX) 
today introduced a new Express Scripts Medicare(R) Prescription Drug 
Plan (PDP) for 2018 called the Saver plan, a low-premium Part D plan 
that provides affordable access to nearly 3,000 commonly used 
medications and a preferred pharmacy network with CVS Pharmacy  and the 
Kroger Family of Pharmacies. 
 
 
   "When it comes to a Medicare Part D plan, there is no such thing as one 
size fits all. Express Scripts ' ability to work with different partners 
across the pharmacy supply chain allows us to create a variety of 
valuable plans that provide safe, high-quality access to prescription 
medications for all seniors," said Jennie Knisley, vice president, 
Medicare prescription drug plans, Express Scripts. "Our new Saver plan 
is a low-cost option for seniors who need a plan that provides the 
essentials and helps them affordably avoid delayed enrollment penalties, 
while our Choice and Value plans provide broader medication access and 
preferred pharmacy options for seniors with more complex medication 
needs." 
 
 
   The Saver plan offers a low premium of $22.60 per month[1] -- less than 
$1 per day -- and a $0 deductible on tier 1 and tier 2 generics. Copays 
are $1 for tier 1 generic medications and $4 for tier 2 generic 
medications when filled at one of more than 8,000 CVS pharmacies or more 
than 2,000 Kroger  pharmacies nationwide. The copays for a 90-day supply 
of tier 1 or tier 2 generic medications are just $2 and $8, respectively, 
via home delivery by the Express Scripts Pharmacy(SM) . 
 
 
   In addition to the Saver plan, the Express Scripts Medicare Value and 
Choice plans, currently rated 4 Stars(2) , provide a more comprehensive 
formulary and cover up to 75 percent of the costs, after the deductible, 
for specialty medications -- high-cost drugs that treat complex, chronic 
conditions. The Choice plan also will provide coverage in the Gap for a 
select group of tier 3 brand drugs above the standard gap coverage in 
2018. 
 
 
   Both the Value and Choice plans will continue providing additional cost 
savings through a preferred pharmacy network that features more than 
8,200 Walgreens  pharmacies, 2,000 Kroger  pharmacies and more than more 
than 12,000 independent pharmacies nationwide. 
 
 
   "Express Scripts Medicare plans are built on more than a decade of 
experience providing care to millions of Medicare beneficiaries," said 
Knisley. "All enrollees have 24/7 access to Express Scripts  pharmacists 
to answer prescription medication questions, and access to our 
specialist pharmacists and nurses who have enhanced condition-specific 
training and experience, and offer patients with ongoing personalized 
care and support to ensure optimal health outcomes." 
 
 
   Enrollment for the 2018 plan year begins October 15, 2017 and ends 
December 7, 2017. Coverage begins on January 1, 2018.  Saver, Choice and 
Value plans are offered in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and 
Puerto Rico(3) .
