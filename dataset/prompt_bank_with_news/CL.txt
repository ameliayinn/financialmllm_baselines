NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 18, 2017-- 

Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), as part of its strategy to focus on its higher-margin oral care, personal care and pet nutrition businesses, today announced that it has agreed to purchase PCA Skin and EltaMD, two of the fastest-growing brands in professional skin care, in two separate transactions. These acquisitions will enable Colgate to enter the highly attractive professional skin care category while complementing its existing global personal care businesses.

PCA Skin is a leader in medical-grade in-office and take-home skin care products, and has strong support from dermatologists, plastic surgeons and aestheticians. EltaMD is a leading physician-dispensed sun care brand with a unique positioning around broad-spectrum, everyday use, physician-dispensed sunscreen.

Estimated 2017 net sales for PCA Skin and EltaMD combined approximate $100 million. Both brands are similar in size and are primarily sold through professional skin care channels and online. They are distributed in the U.S., China and certain other international markets. Colgate plans to continue to operate the brands independently after closing.

Ian Cook, Colgate's Chairman, President and CEO commented, "PCA Skin and EltaMD form an exciting combination for Colgate's entry into the professional skin care category. We are delighted that these high-growth, high-margin brands will strengthen our global personal care business. Their complementary product portfolios and sales forces, strong professional support and similar distribution channels will advance Colgate's presence in the premium global skin care category. Furthermore, these businesses will benefit from Colgate's decades long legacy of working with professional experts to deliver recommendations that benefit their patients."

The terms of the deals have not been disclosed. Both transactions are currently expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. The acquisitions are subject to customary closing conditions, including U.S. antitrust clearance.

These transactions are expected to have no impact on earnings in 2018.

Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acted as legal advisor to Colgate-Palmolive on both transactions and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor to Colgate-Palmolive on the acquisition of EltaMD.
