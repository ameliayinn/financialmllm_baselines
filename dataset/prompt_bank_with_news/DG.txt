   "Dollar General  is excited to expand our supply chain and distribution 
operations in the Lone Star state with today's announcement," said Todd 
Vasos , Dollar General's chief executive officer. "This facility is 
expected to support Dollar General 's growing store count in Texas where 
we already operate more than 1,400 current locations and have 
complementary operations in San Antonio. We look forward to the facility 
helping better serve our customers with value and convenience, as well 
as creating career opportunities for approximately 400 future Dollar 
General  employees. I would like to express my gratitude for our 
partnership with Texas Governor Greg Abbott, leadership in both Gregg 
County and the city of Longview and the Longview Economic Development 
Corporation , all of whom helped support this project." 
 
 
   Dollar General  plans to make the Longview distribution center its 17(th) 
facility in the major discount retailer's distribution network and 
second in Texas. In 2014, Dollar General  announced plans to build its 
first Texas distribution center in San Antonio, Texas. Located in Bexar 
County, that facility celebrated its grand opening in 2016. 
 
 
   In addition to the full-time jobs the facility is expected to create, 
Dollar General  also anticipates a strong economic impact through 
hundreds of jobs needed to construct the nearly 1,000,000 square foot 
building. Dollar General  has selected Clayco as the project's official 
general contractor, Leo A. Daly as the architectural engineering firm 
and Elan Design as the civil engineering firm. 
 
 
   Dollar General  takes a number of factors into consideration when 
choosing distribution centers including its location, its proximity to 
Dollar General  stores, its local business environment and workforce and 
the availability of local and state economic incentives, among many 
others. 
 
 
   "Texas' dynamic and booming economy is attracting new businesses every 
day, and we are honored to welcome Dollar General 's new distribution 
center to Longview as the latest example," said Texas Governor Greg 
Abbott. "I am proud that companies like Dollar General  continue to 
invest in our top-notch workforce, and I am excited about this 
partnership and the positive impact it will have on the Longview 
community." 
 
 
   "A project of this magnitude absolutely requires a team effort and 
creative ideas," said Wayne Mansfield, Longview Economic Development 
Corporation CEO. "We are grateful for the spirit of cooperation between 
Dollar General  and our local economic development partners in order to 
bring this project to completion. The result of this collaboration will 
provide 400 jobs for our citizens and expand our tax base. The 
successful recruitment of Dollar General  is testimony to the competitive 
advantages Longview and Gregg County possess. Dollar General 's 
reputation of success will fit well with our community." 
 
 
   Dollar General  currently has more than 1,400 stores and over 12,000 
employees in Texas. Dollar General  currently has 15 distribution centers 
that are located in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, 
Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South 
Carolina, Texas (San Antonio), Virginia and Wisconsin. The Company's 
16(th) distribution center in Amsterdam, New York is currently under 
construction.
