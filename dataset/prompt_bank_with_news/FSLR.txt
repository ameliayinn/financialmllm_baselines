0957 ET - Oil industry hopes for a recovery in global oil and fuel demand toward pre-coronavirus levels are finding encouragement in rebounding tire sales as more businesses, schools and institutions reopen. "Tire demand continues on road to recovery," say analysts at Tudor Pickering. "August '20 tire sales from Michelin showed promising figures for almost every geography across OEM [original equipment manufacturer] and replacement. China continues to be the main point of strength ... This pushed the QTD demand figures for OEM and replacement to roughly +12% and +11%, respectively, well ahead of Q2 levels of -1% and +4%." North America is a laggard, but even there sales are better this quarter than last, they add. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

0905 ET - US benchmark oil prices slip back below $40 a barrel after two days of impressive gains, but are still finding price support over concerns about more storms in the Gulf of Mexico that could again knock out offshore production and tighten supplies. Just as Hurricane Sally loses steam and moves away from offshore production platforms, the National Hurricane Center alerts to another storm in the southwestern part of the Gulf near Mexico that it says could become a tropical storm later today and may start moving north-northeast. That could again force companies like Shell and BP to re-shut or keep shut operations they halted due to Sally. WTI trades 0.5% lower at $39.98/bbl. ( dan.molinski@wsj.com )

2039 ET - In an environment where ESG is becoming increasingly important and capital is being allocated away from upstream energy projects, Citi says the number of bidders for oil-and-gas assets could be thinner than before. That is especially true of assets that don't offering a fast payback on investment, such as liquefied natural gas, the investment bank says. "The problem we see is buyers may be aware of the balance sheet imperative, potentially affecting see-through valuations," Citi says. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

2036 ET - There's a small risk that Woodside will raise equity after its November strategy day, but the Australian energy company is more likely to tap investors when it green-lights its Scarborough gas field and Pluto-2 expansion, Citi says. An equity raise is likely then even if Woodside can successfully sell stakes in all three of its growth projects, which includes the Sangomar oil-field development in Senegal. Woodside is pre-empting the sale of Cairn Energy 's stake in Sangomar, which will feed into decisions by its credit rating companies. Woodside wants to maintain three notches above sub-investment grade ahead of capital expenditure on Scarborough and Pluto-2, Citi says. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

2030 ET - Citi finds that M&A in the oil and gas sector typically bounces back when oil futures flatten from steep contango, when there have been 5-6 quarters of rising oil prices, and when credit markets are open. Citi forecasts a big drawdown in crude-oil stockpiles globally, starting in 4Q of this year and running through 2021. That would see Brent oil prices rise above US$50/bbl, while central banks keep credit markets liquid. "In theory this implies more supportive M&A markets in 2H 2021, aligned with the targeted timing of final investment decisions" such as Oil Search 's Pikka oil field, Woodside's Scarborough gas field and the Santos-led Dorado oil field, Citi says.

2011 ET - Australian engineering contractors have underperformed the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index by 26 percentage points since the coronavirus pandemic began, but Macquarie sees rewards for investors that stick with the stocks. History could be a guide: Macquarie notes that Downer EDI and Worley both outperformed after SARS was contained in 2003. The investment bank retains an outperform call on both stocks, and recently upgraded Monadelphous to outperform from neutral. For Downer, it says potential sales of assets such as its mining and laundries businesses would be positive catalysts. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)
