Athene Holding Ltd . ("Athene") (NYSE: ATH) announced today that Athene Annuity and Life Company ("AAIA"), Athene's wholly-owned Iowa-domiciled life insurance subsidiary, has entered into a pension buyout agreement with Molson Coors Brewing Company (NYSE: TAP; TSX: TPX) and its wholly-owned subsidiary MillerCoors LLC ("MillerCoors "). The transaction is structured as a buyout arrangement in which AAIA agrees to provide annuity benefits to more than 6,000 retirees and beneficiaries who are receiving benefits from the MillerCoors LLC Pension Plan (the "Plan"). Under this deal, MillerCoors is transferring over $900 million in pension obligations to Athene. Starting May 1, 2018, Athene will begin making benefit payments to the affected individuals along with providing ongoing administrative services. Retirees and beneficiaries will receive the same monthly benefit they were previously receiving from the Plan.

"We are proud MillerCoors has entrusted Athene to provide retirement security to more than 6,000 of the company's retirees and beneficiaries, " said William Wheeler , president of Athene Holding . "As a disciplined financial institution with expertise in retirement savings, Athene has established itself as a trusted pension buyout counterparty. This transaction enables MillerCoors to reduce the size and cost of its plan, while maintaining excellent benefit security for its retirees and beneficiaries."

Under the agreement, AAIA will issue a group annuity contract to MillerCoors and individual annuity certificates to applicable retirees and beneficiaries. AAIA will have direct payment responsibility for all the liabilities covered in this transaction.

This is Athene's fourth pension risk transfer deal in 2017. Athene now has written over $2.25 billion of business in this channel serving over 46,000 retirees and beneficiaries.
