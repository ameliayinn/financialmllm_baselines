PLANO, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 03, 2017-- 

Tyler Technologies, Inc . (NYSE: TYL) was selected for cooperative purchasing by the Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) of New York state, a distinction reserved for select vendors. Tyler's student transportation solution, Traversa(R) , is now an approved selection as part of the statewide administrative software bidding process.

Through this classification, New York school districts can purchase Traversa directly through the BOCES cooperative purchasing program without going out to bid, eliminating the time-consuming RFP process used by many districts.

Tyler's Traversa solution is a comprehensive program which includes functionality for routing, fleet maintenance, and activity trips, and offers a seamless user experience that can be used to plan event trips, track work orders, and route buses. Traversa can also be enhanced by the Tyler Drive(TM) on-board tablet and Tyler Telematic GPS hardware. In 2017 to date, Traversa has been selected for use by 17 new clients in New York. BOCES included Traversa in its 2017 software re-bid process because of the software's extreme popularity, allowing Tyler to be an approved vendor going forward.

"We are pleased to be recognized by the Board of Cooperative Education Services in New York for our Traversa student transportation software," said Ted Thien, vice president and general manager of Tyler's transportation solutions. "We've already been able to provide our comprehensive system to several New York school districts, and we expect to bring fully-integrated student transportation functionality to additional clients because of the cooperative purchasing agreement."

There are 37 BOCES in New York, partnering with nearly all the state's school districts to help meet students' evolving educational needs through cost-effective and relevant programs. School districts receive funds from the state, called BOCES aid, for the shared services purchased the previous year.

Tyler offers a broad portfolio of school solutions in addition to transportation software, including data analytics, document management, incident management, student information, and financial management. Nationwide, Tyler has nearly 2,000 transportation clients.
