1036 ET - Despite Harvey and Irma, Hannover Rueck (HNR1.XE) could still reach its goal of 1 billion euros in profit for the year, says DZ Bank, as it raises the price target to EUR112 from EUR107. Analysts see a good opportunity for investment and raise Hannover Rueck's evaluation to buy from hold. The storms may end price erosion in the reinsurance market or at least trigger price hikes for contracts affected by damages, DZ Bank notes. With a 230% solvency ratio, Hannover Rueck is in a good position to make use of upcoming opportunities without having to cancel its special dividend, the bank added. Shares trade down 0.6% at EUR101.20. (Max.Bernhard@dowjones.com; @mxbernhard)

1037 ET - A record-high level of jobs openings might overstate tightness in the labor market. There were 6.17 million job openings at the end of July, setting another record high, Labor Department says. Openings have increased by nearly 200,000 from a year earlier. That could suggest employers are struggling to find qualified employees. It's also possible that firms aren't terribly motivated to fill all their openings, and instead are using internet posting to fish for perfect candidates. If the labor market were as tight as the openings figure suggests, wages would likely be rising faster than the 2.5% pace essentially held since late 2015. (eric.morath@wsj.com; @ericmorath)

1036 ET - DowDuPont (DWDP) restructures the way it talks about its specialty-chemicals company, setting up four divisions that are targeting end customers in electronics & imaging, transportation, construction and nutrition & biosciences. That leads to an immediate question from an analyst on a conference call if each of those businesses will be separated. CEO Edward Breen, viewed by analysts and investors as the likely leader of specialty-chemicals even though he hasn't declared a post-split role, leaves a further breakup squarely on the table. Known for breaking up Tyco, Breen says the divisions indeed are independent entities with "a lot of optionality." He also talks about running a lean operation with little corporate overhead, though he said there are some links between business lines. DWDP up 2.4% to $68.47. (david.benoit@wsj.com; @DaveCBenoit)

1028 ET - Volatility builds in oil markets as investors shift some attention away from US hurricanes to re-focus on the fundamentals of global supply and demand, and whether OPEC may make more attempts at balancing the market. US crude oil prices took a brief but sharp turn lower early in NY trading when the Financial Times, citing Nigeria's oil minister, said the African country will resist any attempts to curb its oil production when it meets with OPEC and Russia later this month. That pushed WTI under $48, but the benchmark has since regained its footing, rising 0.4% to $48.26/bbl. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

1016 ET - Bunge's (BG) planned purchase of a controlling stake in palm oil supplier IOI Loders makes Bunge a bigger player in edible oils, but also in the debate over deforestation that has grown alongside the industry. Parent IOI Group in April committed to improving sustainability and labor practices after being expelled last year from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil for clearing land in Indonesia, which Bunge CEO Soren Schroder says cost IOI business. Bunge's deal doesn't involve palm-oil plantations, Schroder tells analysts on a conference call, and rather than an increased reputational risk, he sees "an opportunity for us to influence and be a partner in driving sustainable practices across the food industry." BG falls 6.6% to $70.73. (jacob.bunge@wsj.com; @jacobbunge)

1013 ET - Hog futures fall sharply at the opening as cash and pork prices continue to trend downward. Meatpackers are expected to bid a further 50 cents to $1.50 less for slaughter-ready hogs in the day's cash trade. CME October lean hog futures fall 1.8% to 60.5 cents a pound. Cattle futures drift lower as large supplies continue to pressure the market, despite expectations of an upcoming seasonal bottom. Beef prices in particular were lower on Monday. CME October live cattle contracts fall 0.1% to $1.071 a pound. (benjamin.parkin@wsj.com; @b_parkyn)

1008 ET - DowDuPont (DWDP) has managed to please both the legacy Dow executives and its activists in changing how it planned to break itself into three. DWDP review of the original plan as announced in December 2015, is splitting the legacy Dow Corning among the planned materials company -- which is Dow 2.0 -- and the planned specialty-chemical company. That business had been the crux of activist complaints and core to Dow's way of thinking, but by focusing on end customers the review was able to split about 40% of Dow Corning and send it to specialty from Dow 2.0. Activists are saying the plan looks good this morning. Trian, says it's the right outcome and Glenview calls it "significant improvements," though adds they would like to see capital allocation changes as well. DWDP rises 2.7% to $68.64.

0957 ET - Bunge's (BG) edible-oils deal to buy a controlling interest in Malaysian company IOI Loders earns BG a downgrade from Vertical Group analysts: "In our view, this transaction does not create shareholder value." IOI's oil business is somewhat more stable and higher-value than some of BG's existing oil operations, but still volatile and the $946M price BG agreed to pay looks rich, Vertical says. "It also makes a takeover [of Bunge] less likely and we wonder whether that is the true motivation for the acquisition," it adds. Vertical downgrades BG to hold, shares down 6%.

0952 ET - Bunge (BG) investors are disappointed after the agribusiness says it will pay $946M for a 70% stake in IOI Loders Croklaan, a maker of edible oils. Bunge CEO Soren Schroder on a conference call pitches the deal as "game changing" for Bunge's vegetable oil franchise, helping the commodity trader fill in regional gaps and products it wasn't offering. But traders, with Glencore's recent deal approach to BG fresh in their minds, may worry this wasn't the type of deal they imagined as Bunge continues to struggle against a tough agricultural market. BG shares down 5%, erasing YTD gains. (jacob.bunge@wsj.com; @jacobbunge)

0935 ET - Corporate officials have been growing more chipper on earnings calls. The number of times they mentioned the word "better," compared to "worse" or "weaker" remained above average levels in 2Q, Bank of America Merrill Lynch says in a report. The three-month ratio of above versus below-consensus earnings guidance also rose in August to 1.24, its highest level in more than six years. "While political uncertainty could keep capex depressed in the near-term, the positive outlook from management in spite of this uncertainty is encouraging," BoFA says. (akane.otani@wsj.com)

0928 ET - Treasuries weakened as traders prepared for today's $20B auction of benchmark 10-year notes amid an absence of compelling economic data. As geopolitical concerns recede and investors focus on damage from Hurricane Irma that was less than many forecasters feared, the 10-year yield has climbed to 2.162%, according to Tradeweb, from 2.058% at last week's close. The auction is expected to price at the lowest yield since November, raising concerns that sticker shock may drive away some buyers, even as inflation expectations remain soft and speculation is growing that the Federal Reserve may not raise rates for the rest of the year.
