1252 ET - Google 's $1.1B purchase of a part of HTC is coming with some non-exclusive rights to HTC intellectual property and 2,000 employees from the Taiwanese smartphone maker's phone-design group. The companies didn't disclose the number of employees joining Google late Wednesday when announcing the deal. Google 's purchase price appears to be steep, given the relatively small number of employees and the fact HTC's market value was $1.9B before the deal. But Google likely sees the price worth it to help it gain share in the crowded smartphone market. Google 's hardware chief Rick Osterloh said in a blog post, "We're investing in the long run."

1219 ET - Shares of drugmaker Intercept Pharmaceuticals are down 9% after the FDA issues a safety alert warning of an increased risk of serious liver injury and death in certain patients taking the company's liver-disease drug Ocaliva. FDA says some patients who already have moderate to severe liver-function impairment are getting excessive doses of the drug. FDA cautions doctors to start such patients on lower doses. The FDA alert comes a week after ICPT sent a letter to doctors alerting them to the safety risk, but Leerink notes that the FDA 's alert could signal the agency will impose restrictions on use of the drug that are more severe than investors previously thought.

1202 ET - Turkish Airlines is cutting costs by hiring one law firm to coordinate all of its day-to-day needs, instead of the 120 or so it used to employ. International firm Eversheds Sutherland landed the assignment, which comes with a fixed price tag for three years of work that'll get paid monthly. The firm doesn't disclose the number. Eversheds will coordinate work in the more than 100 countries where Turkish Air has a presence, including advising on customer complaints, intellectual property, labor issues and local regulations. Eversheds has landed similar assignments for clients Dupont and Tyco International , says Stephen Hopkins , the firm's head of global client development, and has systems in place to manage such worldwide assignments. The contract doesn't include any unexpected legal matters, like bet-the-company litigation or significant M&A, but Eversheds will have a crack at those assignments as they come, both sides say. So far, such partnerships between corporations and firms have been more common abroad, but Hopkins said they're looking at similar deals with US companies. (sara.randazzo@wsj.com; @sara_randazzo)

1152 ET - The Senate Banking Committee confirms it will hold another Wells Fargo hearing on Tuesday at 10 am. CEO Timothy Sloan will be the sole witness at the hearing, titled "Wells Fargo : One Year Later," according to the committee. It didn't give further details about the hearing, but WSJ and Reuters earlier Thursday reported Sloan is expected to focus on updated information around the scope of the bank's sales practices scandal and more recent problems in its consumer-lending unit, particularly on improperly charging customers for certain auto insurance. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman says the bank does "welcome the opportunity to further update the Committee about the progress Wells Fargo has made over the last year." She adds that since October, the bank has "taken numerous important steps to fix issues, make things right for our customers and build a better bank." (emily.glazer@wsj.com; @EmilyGlazerWSJ)

1145 ET - US shale production should grow by 1.5M barrels a day in 2017, with positive implications for American refiners, according to Giacomo Romeo, an oil and gas analyst at Macquarie Capital. "This shift in production has driven increased downstream investment, with US operable refining capacity increasing 750,000 barrels a day since 2015," Romeo says at a European refining summit in Brussels Thursday. Conversely, refining capacity should remain flat in Europe, with the potential for up to 400,000 barrels a day in capacity reduction if margins were to fall back to 2014, he adds.

1132 ET - Days after filing for bankruptcy protection, Toys 'R' Us says it still plans to hire more than 13,000 temporary workers for the holiday season. The tally includes 2,400 seasonal workers at a DHL fulfillment center in Groveport, Ohio, and 900 customer-service agents that work from home. It will be reducing its hiring in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Chicago compared with last year, when it said it planned to hire about 10,900 seasonal staff. (michelle.ma@wsj.com)Toys 'R' Us says it's hiring seasonal workers for the holiday season despite filing for bankruptcy protection. "Toy 'R' Us Still Hiring, Needs 13,000 Seasonal Workers -- Market Talk," at 6:00 ET, misstated the company's name in the headline.

1110 ET - A monthly gauge of rural economy health falls to its lowest point for the year, reflecting ongoing trouble in the US Farm Belt. The index, drawn from a survey of farm bankers in 10 states by Creighton University, in September fell to 39.6, the lowest level since December. Creighton says Midwestern lenders remain pessimistic about the farm economy thanks to concerns over low commodity prices, trade and a drought that struck parts of the Farm Belt this year. About 51% of bankers reported restructuring loans to farmers, according to Creighton, while nearly 19% say they've increased collateral requirements. Still, farm-loan defaults rise just 2.1% over the past year and delinquencies 4.1%. One Illinois banker says early harvest results indicate the state's crop will be 15% to 20% smaller than last year. "With this reduction and current low prices our farmers' incomes will be significantly less than 2016," he says. (jesse.newman@wsj.com; @jessenewman13)

1109 ET - Wells Fargo CEO Timothy Sloan is expected to testify at a Senate Banking Committee hearing in early October, a person familiar with the matter said. The Wells Fargo chief is expected to detail the bank's latest efforts related to its sales practices scandal in addition to other problems that have arisen in its consumer lending unit, this person said. Democratic senators sent a letter to the committee in recent weeks urging for another hearing after news erupted of other problems at the bank, particularly around improperly charging around 500,000 customers for certain auto insurance resulting in $80M in refunds. This isn't the first time Wells Fargo has faced Congressional hearings. About a year ago Sloan's predecessor John Stumpf was grilled in two hearings following the eruption of the bank's sales practices scandal, where it opened accounts for customers using fictitious or unauthorized customer information. Reuters earlier reported news of the upcoming hearing. (emily.glazer@wsj.com; @EmilyGlazerWSJ)
