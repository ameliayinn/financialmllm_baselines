Evergy, Inc . (NYSE: EVRG) today announced third quarter 2020 earnings of $365 million, or $1.60 per share, compared with earnings of $367 million, or $1.56 per share, for the third quarter of 2019.

Evergy's adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP) were $393 million and $1.73, respectively, in the third quarter of 2020 compared with $370 million and $1.57, respectively, in the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP) are reconciled to GAAP earnings in the financial table included in this release.

Third quarter earnings per share were driven higher by lower operations and maintenance expense due to continued cost management, an increase in weather-normalized demand due to higher residential demand and fewer shares outstanding. These benefits were partially offset by lower gross margin from unfavorable weather.

"Our team's focus on execution is reflected in great results this quarter," said Terry Bassham , Evergy president and chief executive officer. "We remain focused on responsible cost reductions and ramping up infrastructure investment consistent with our Sustainability Transformation Plan to drive long-term value for both customers and shareholders."

2020 Outlook

Evergy is narrowing 2020 GAAP EPS guidance to $2.58 to $2.73 and adjusted EPS guidance to $2.95 to $3.10, reflecting the upper half of the prior ranges.

Dividend Declaration

The Board of Directors declared a dividend on the company's common stock of $0.535 per share payable on December 21, 2020. The dividends are payable to shareholders of record as of November 20, 2020.
