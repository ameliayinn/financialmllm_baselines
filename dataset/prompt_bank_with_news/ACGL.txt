1446 ET - Thirteen property-casualty insurers, four life insurers and two insurance brokers increased their quarterly dividends in 1Q, and the trend should continue through 2018, says RBC Capital Markets . The P&C companies and brokers upped their dividends by 18% on average, versus a 15% increase for the life insurers. Investors are more eager for dividends than for buybacks, RBC says. "There have been a few big dividend increases following the passage of US tax reform, but we could just as easily make the case that these dividend increases would have taken place even without tax reform."

1419 ET - The slowdown in Mexican inflation and recent gains in the peso raise the bar for the Bank of Mexico to increase interest rates again, says Goldman Sachs after inflation eased to 5.04% in March from 5.34% the previous month and 6.77% in December. While renewed inflation shocks via the exchange rate or other channels could spark near-term rate increases, if the peso holds under 19 to the US dollar and the market digests US rate increases well, the central bank should remain on hold at 7.5% "for a while," the firm adds. Risks for the possibility of interest-rate cuts toward the end of the year include the outcome of Nafta talks and Mexico's July presidential election. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)

1213 ET - Some companies are giving bonuses and raising wages to share the benefits of lower taxes under the tax overhaul by Republicans in Congress. MGIC Investment is joining the movement--by reducing borrower-paid premium rates on mortgage insurance. "Bottom line, MTG plans on passing along tax cut-related savings to customers," Barclays writes. From Wall Street's perspective, this isn't great news for mortgage insurers such as Arch Capital . "While we thought it would be inevitable that the benefits of tax cuts could be competed away through pricing over time," Barclays writes, analysts there didn't expect it this soon. "We suspect this will come as a surprise to the market." (leslie.scism@wsj.com)

0747 ET - London's AIM junior market is still a good place to do business, though the growing size of AIM-listed companies could present an issue, says Moore Stephens . A survey of AIM companies by the accountancy firm showed they have achieved significantly larger market capitalizations--up 59% to an average of GBP111 million ($156.62 million) in December 2017 from GBP70 million in December 2013. Moore Stephen says this underlines the fact that AIM is doing well. Still, there is an impression that as capitalizations get larger, smaller companies shouldn't be on AIM, says Moore Stephens 's Marty Lau . "If this trend is being pushed by regulators, there could be a risk the lines between AIM and the main market become blurred, to AIM's detriment." (philip.waller@wsj.com)

0716 ET - An investigation into loans extended by India's ICICI Bank involving potential conflict of interest for its CEO could hurt the bank's reputation, says Fitch Ratings .

But the ongoinginvestigation could undermine investors' confidence in ICICI bank, as well as opens the risk of regulatory sanctions, says Fitch. It adds that Fitch would review rating action if the risk for the bank rises considerably. ( debiprasad.nayak@wsj.com )
