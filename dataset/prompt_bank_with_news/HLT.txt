Charts New Course

Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. on Friday announced a $1 billion share buyback program and launched a dividend in the wake of a major reorganization of its business.

The company also said it would change its name to Hilton Inc., effective March 6.

In January, Hilton completed the spinoff of a chunk of hotels into a real estate investment trust. The company also completed the separation of its timeshare business, a move that follows similar steps by rivals.

The company said Friday it would pay a quarterly dividend of 15 cents a share.

FOOTLOCKER

Shoe Retailer Posts

Improved Results

Foot Locker Inc. reported a rise in fourth-quarter profit and revenue amid a slowdown in the retail industry.

Same-store sales at the sports-apparel retailer topped expectations, growing 5%. Analysts had projected a 4.6% increase.

The athletic store's performance recently has been helped by trendy sneakers that have customers buying shoes for fashion rather than competition, even as shoppers have skipped many other mall-based stores.

In all, Foot Locker reported a profit of $189 million, or $1.42 a share, up from $158 million, or $1.14, a year earlier.

Revenue increased 5.3% to $2.11 billion.
