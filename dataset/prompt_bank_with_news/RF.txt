Fitch Ratings -Chicago-03 October 2017: Following its peer review of large regional banks, Fitch Ratings has taken various rating actions.

Fitch upgraded Regions Financial Corporation 's (RF) ratings to 'BBB+', and revised the bank's Rating Outlook to Stable from Positive. In addition, Fitch downgraded Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) and Wells Fargo & Company 's ratings and assigned both entities Stable Outlooks (WFC). Fitch affirmed the ratings on Comerica Incorporated (CMA) and KeyCorp (KEY) and revised their Outlooks to Stable from Negative.

Fitch affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) for the remaining large regional banks (listed below) in the peer review with Stable Outlooks.

--BB&T Corporation (BBT);

--Capital One Financial Corporation (COF);

--Citizens Financial Group (CFG);

--Huntington Bancshares Inc . (HBAN);

--M&T Bank Corporation (MTB);

--MUFG Americas Holding Corporation (MUAH);

--PNC Financial Services Group (PNC);

--SunTrust Banks, Inc (STI);.

--U.S. Bancorp (USB).

Fitch downgraded the Long- and Short-Term IDRs of Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) to 'A+'/'F1' from 'AA-'/'F1+', respectively. Fitch also downgraded Wells Fargo Bank, N.A .'s (WFBNA) Long-Term IDR to 'AA-' from 'AA'. WFBNA's Short-Term IDR was affirmed at 'F1+'. The rating action reflects Fitch's view of WFC's earnings profile, risk controls, and governance. Historically, WFC's above peer level ratings were primarily supported by its superior earnings profile and a risk management infrastructure that was viewed favourably, and steered the company well through the financial crisis. Nonetheless, Fitch does not believe WFC's earnings profile will exceed peer levels to the same degree it has in the past, and the agency acknowledges several notable missteps in WFC's risk controls and governance infrastructure that warranted the ratings downgrade. At WFC's new ratings levels, it remains one of the highest rated banks in the world, supported by its solid franchise, capital and liquidity profiles.

Fitch affirmed CMA's Long-term IDR at 'A' and revised the Rating Outlook to Stable from Negative. The Stable Outlook reflects the view that future credit costs related to the energy portfolio will likely remain contained and should not materially impact overall financial performance. Positively, the company has executed quickly on reducing energy exposure (direct and indirect lending) down to 4% for 2Q17 compared to 8% at 2Q15. CMA's ratings are also supported by the company's solid tangible capital base, strong funding profile, proven credit performance through various credit cycles and consistent performance. Although earnings performance has lagged peers for several years, over the last four quarters, CMA's profitability measures are trending at peer median levels. Fitch also recognizes that CMA's earnings profile is one of the most consistent.

Fitch also affirmed KEY's Long-term IDR at 'A-' and revised the Rating Outlook to Stable from Negative, reflecting Fitch's view that KEY has demonstrated successful progress with its integration of FNFG, including the targeted branch closures, the exiting of FNFG's over 200 third party vendor relationships, and integrating FNFG into KEY's platforms. KEY remains on track to execute on its financial targets announced at the acquisition and should benefit from revenue synergies. KEY's ratings are also supported by the company's strong capital position, solid asset quality performance, diversified revenue mix, and reduced risk profile

RF's ratings were upgraded to 'BBB+'/'F2' and its Rating Outlook revised to Stable from Positive, reflecting Fitch's view that RF's operating performance and overall financial condition have continued to converge with higher rated peers. The upgrade also reflects RF's strengthened risk management, evidenced by reasonable credit losses through the energy downturn and limited loan growth over recent periods.

Fitch downgraded Fifth Third Bancorp and Fifth Third Bank 's Long-term IDRs to 'A-' from 'A'/ Stable Outlook. Fitch also affirmed both bank's Short-term IDRs at 'F1'. These rating actions reflect earnings profiles that no longer outperform peers. Fitch still views FITB as a high quality bank, and in line with the large regional bank peer group average.

Fitch has published Rating Action Commentaries for each of the large regional banks, which are available at www.fitchratings.com. These include each issuer's key rating drivers and rating sensitivities and lists of all rating actions taken.

The manner of Fitchâ tms factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitchâ tms ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.
