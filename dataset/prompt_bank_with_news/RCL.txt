Cruising Trends and Growth

Cruises are gaining popularity, and more than 100 million people are expected to take a cruise in the next four years.(2) In fact, cruises enjoy the highest satisfaction rate of any vacation, and 84 percent of cruisers would recommend cruising to a friend.(3) And despite misconceptions and anxiety about cruise expenses(4) , included amenities like meals, activities, and room service can make voyages much more cost-effective than land-based vacations. Plus, travelers can visit multiple destinations without extra transportation costs. As cruise lines look to continue to shake up assumptions of what a cruise can be, here are some industry trends making major waves: 


   -- New ships on the block. Over 100 new cruise ships will debut in the next 
      decade, and 26 new ocean, river and specialty cruise ships are expected 
      to debut in 2017 alone. 
 
   -- All-time favorites meet new frontiers. According to a recent survey5, the 
      most in-demand cruises continue to be ever-popular routes to the 
      Caribbean and Alaska. However, expedition cruises are also growing in 
      popularity as more cruise lines are offering itineraries to the Galapagos 
      Islands and remote polar regions. 
 
   -- New Panama Canal. Another key catalyst driving the cruise industry's 
      growth is the widening of the Panama Canal. The nine-year canal expansion 
      project will enable bigger cargo ships and many of the world's biggest 
      cruise ships to pass through, cutting off the extra 8,000 miles it would 
      take to sail around Cape Horn. 
 
   -- Nearly 20 percent of millennials plan to take a cruise in the next 12 
      months.6 Many cruise lines are wooing millennial travelers with high-tech 
      amenities, fun onboard activities (ziplines, mixology classes, skydiving 
      simulators) and late-night dance parties with international DJs. Carnival 
      Cruise Line's Carnival Vista even has its own brewery. 
 
   -- Private beach attractions are gaining popularity. Cruise lines are 
      investing more in exclusive ownership of private islands to enhance the 
      guest experience. These islands -- like Royal Caribbean 's CocoCay -- are 
      equipped with luxury amenities, bars, easier accessibility, acres of 
      lounge chairs, and beach pavilions. 
 
   -- Sea foodies. Survey respondents ranked cruises for foodies and gourmands 
      as the most popular themed cruise type7, and there is no shortage of 
      delectable options to explore. Norwegian Cruise Line  has their "Meet the 
      Winemaker Cruises," which allows passengers the opportunity to wine and 
      dine with leaders and legends of the wine making industry. Last year 
      Holland America partnered with America's Test Kitchen to bring live 
      onboard cooking shows and hands-on workshops on select ships. 
 
   -- Celebrity performances. Cruise lines continue to draw celebrities to 
      perform on their ships, with past headliners including Demi Lovato, 
      Bonnie Tyler, and Carrie Underwood. It's been two years since their last 
      cruise, but next year Backstreet's back! The Backstreet Boys Cruise with 
      Carnival Cruise Lines  sails from Miami to Grand Turk May 3-7, 2018. 
 
   -- Luxury cruises are going all out. The world's finest cruises allow 
      travelers to experience first-class amenities and other extravagances 
      like infinity pools, underwater lounges and helicopters. 

6 Ways to Save On Your Next Cruise Vacation

For travelers looking to get a great price on their next sea voyage, Expedia has a few money-saving tips to keep in mind: 


   -- Book your cruise through a travel agent -- like Expedia  
      CruiseShipCenters . Travel agents can negotiate contracted rates directly 
      with cruise lines so they can save travelers on average $452 per trip.8 
 
   -- When planning a cruise vacation, book early. Often, cruise lines will 
      offer early booking incentives in the form of low fares, value add-ons 
      and upgrades if you book months in advance, typically six -- 18 months 
      out. 
 
   -- If you have a few friends or family members who want to go on a cruise, 
      take advantage of group booking discounts. In general, if you book as a 
      large group with most cruise lines, one person will often cruise for 
      free. Fun fact: Expedia CruiseShipCenters  has a Group Program that allows 
      travelers to take advantage of the group booking price without needing to 
      be part of a group. This is something that isn't offered if you were to 
      book directly with the cruise line. 
 
   -- Consider taking a cruise during the off-season or shoulder season when 
      people are no longer taking vacation to net big savings. There can also 
      be a tremendous price difference between one week and the next, so 
      consider alternative weeks to reduce the price of your cruise fare. It 
      pays to be flexible! 
 
   -- Arrange your own shore excursions instead of booking them through the 
      cruise line. Cruise lines offer shore excursions for their passengers but 
      paying for the convenience is pricey. Book your shore activities on 
      Expedia  to save money. 
 
   -- There are many options for finding cruise deals on Expedia  and there are 
      new deals every day. Now through October 31 travelers can get up to $150 
      to spend onboard 2017 Holland America Line  Caribbean cruises. Check out 
      the Expedia Deals page for more last-minute cruise offers.
