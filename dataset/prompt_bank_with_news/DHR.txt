Danaher Reports Third Quarter 2017 Results

PR Newswire

WASHINGTON, Oct. 19, 2017

WASHINGTON, Oct. 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Danaher Corporation (NYSE: DHR) today announced results for the third quarter of 2017. For the quarter ended September 29, 2017, net earnings were $572.1 million, or $0.81 per diluted share which represents a 42.0% year-over-year increase.

Non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.00. This represents a 15.0% increase over the comparable 2016 period. For the third quarter 2017, revenues increased 9.5% year-over-year to $4.5 billion, with non-GAAP core revenue growth of 3.0%.

For the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company anticipates that diluted net earnings per share will be in the range of $0.94 to $0.98 and non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per share will be in the range of $1.12 to $1.16.

For the full year 2017, the Company anticipates that diluted net earnings per share will be in the range of $3.23 to $3.27. The Company is raising its 2017 non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance, and now expects a range of $3.96 to $4.00.

Thomas P. Joyce, Jr ., President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are pleased with our third quarter performance, with the team delivering mid-teens adjusted earnings per share growth, strong margin expansion and cash flow, and improving revenue growth. With the Danaher Business System as our foundation, the team's commitment to continuous improvement was a key driver of our results."

Joyce continued, "Our performance in the quarter - combined with significant opportunities across the portfolio and our strong balance sheet - positions us to build on this momentum through the end of 2017 and into next year."

     the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales 
     attributable to divested businesses or product lines not considered 
     discontinued operations ("acquisition sales") and (2) the impact of 
     currency translation. The portion of GAAP revenue from continuing 
     operations attributable to currency translation is calculated as the 
     difference between (a) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding 
     acquisition sales) and (b) the period-to-period change in revenue 
     (excluding acquisition sales) after applying current period foreign 
     exchange rates to the prior year period. We use the term "core revenue 
     growth" to refer to the measure of comparing current period core revenue 
     with the corresponding period of the prior year.

(B)  Gain on sale of investments in nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 
     ($223 million pretax as presented in this line item, $140 million 
     after-tax). 
 
(C)  Charge for early extinguishment of borrowings for the nine-month period 
     ended September 30, 2016 ($179 million pretax as presented in this line 
     item, $112 million after-tax). 
 
(D)  Gain on resolution of acquisition-related matters for the nine-month 
     period ended September 30, 2016 ($18 million pretax as presented in this 
     line item, $14 million after-tax). 
 
(E)  During the nine-month period ended September 29, 2017, the Company 
     recorded $76 million of pretax restructuring, impairment and other 
     related charges ($51 million after-tax) primarily related to the 
     Company's strategic decision to discontinue a molecular diagnostic 
     product line in its Diagnostics segment. As a result, the Company 
     incurred noncash charges for the impairment of certain technology-related 
     intangibles as well as related inventory and plant, property and 
     equipment with no further use totaling $49 million. In addition, the 
     Company incurred cash restructuring costs primarily related to employee 
     severance and related charges totaling $27 million. This is addressed in 
     more detail in the "Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Measures." 
 
(F)  This line item reflects the aggregate tax effect of all nontax 
     adjustments reflected in the table above. In addition, the footnotes 
     above indicate the after-tax amount of each individual adjustment 
     item. Danaher estimates the tax effect of the adjustment items identified 
     in the reconciliation schedule above by applying Danaher's overall 
     estimated effective tax rate to the pretax amount, unless the nature of 
     the item and/or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded 
     requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment, in which 
     case the tax effect of such item is estimated by applying such specific 
     tax rate or tax treatment. 
 
(G)  Represents (1) discrete income tax gains, primarily related to expiration 
     of statute of limitations ($35 million in the nine-month period ended 
     September 29, 2017), (2) equity compensation-related excess tax benefits 
     ($16 million in the nine-month period ended September 29, 2017) and (3) 
     Fortive separation-related tax costs related to repatriation of earnings, 
     legal entity realignments and other discrete matters ($99 million in the 
     nine-month period ended September 30, 2016). On January 1, 2017, Danaher 
     adopted the updated accounting guidance required by ASU 2016-09, 
     Compensation--Stock Compensation, which requires income statement 
     recognition of all excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to equity 
     compensation. We exclude from Adjusted Diluted Net EPS any excess tax 
     benefits that exceed the levels we believe are representative of 
     historical experience. In the first quarter of 2017, we anticipated $10 
     million of equity compensation-related excess tax benefits and realized 
     $26 million of excess tax benefits, and therefore we have excluded $16 
     million of these benefits in the calculation of Adjusted Diluted Net 
     Earnings per Share. In the second and third quarters of 2017, realized 

19 Oct 2017 06:00 ET 
Press Release: Danaher Reports Third Quarter 2017 -3-


     equity compensation-related excess tax benefits approximated the 
     anticipated benefit and no adjustments were required. 
 

Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Measures

Each of the non-GAAP measures set forth above should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measure, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing Danaher Corporation 's ("Danaher" or the "Company") results that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, help our investors to: 


   -- with respect to Adjusted Diluted Net EPS, understand the long-term 
      profitability trends of our business and compare our profitability to 
      prior and future periods and to our peers; and 
   -- with respect to core revenue, identify underlying growth trends in our 
      business and compare our revenue performance with prior and future 
      periods and to our peers. 

Management uses these non-GAAP measures to measure the Company's operating and financial performance, and uses a non-GAAP measure similar to Adjusted Diluted Net EPS in the Company's executive compensation program.

The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures set forth above have been excluded for the following reasons: 


   -- With respect to Adjusted Diluted Net EPS: 
 
   -- We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 
      because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted 
      by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we 
      consummate.  While we have a history of significant acquisition activity 
      we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an 
      acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related 
      amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary 
      significantly from acquisition to acquisition.  Exclusion of this 
      amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating 
      results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, 
      and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies.  We believe 
      however that it is important for investors to understand that such 
      intangible assets contribute to revenue generation and that intangible 
      asset amortization related to past acquisitions will recur in future 
      periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. 
 
   -- We exclude costs incurred pursuant to discrete restructuring plans that 
      are fundamentally different (in terms of the size, strategic nature and 
      planning requirements, as well as the inconsistent frequency, of such 
      plans) from the ongoing productivity improvements that result from 
      application of the Danaher Business System.  Because these restructuring 
      plans are incremental to the core activities that arise in the ordinary 
      course of our business and we believe are not indicative of Danaher's 
      ongoing operating costs in a given period, we exclude these costs from 
      the calculation of Adjusted Diluted Net EPS to facilitate a more 
      consistent comparison of operating results over time. 
 
   -- With respect to the other items excluded from Adjusted Diluted Net EPS, 
      we exclude these items because they are of a nature and/or size that 
      occur with inconsistent frequency, occur for reasons that may be 
      unrelated to Danaher's commercial performance during the period and/or we 
      believe are not indicative of Danaher's ongoing operating costs or gains 
      in a given period; we believe that such items may obscure underlying 
      business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. 
   -- With respect to core revenue, (1) we exclude the impact of currency 
      translation because it is not under management's control, is subject to 
      volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and (2) we exclude 
      the effect of acquisitions and divested product lines because the timing, 
      size, number and nature of such transactions can vary significantly from 
      period-to-period and between us and our peers, which we believe may 
      obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term 
      performance difficult.
