1233 ET - Global student housing investment inflows have reached record highs in 2016, according to Savills , with volumes going up to $16.45 billion. That's mainly because the asset class provides higher yields at times when commercial real estate yields globally are at their lowest ever. But, student housing "yields may harden as institutional involvement increases, the sector matures and perceived risk diminishes," the real estate advisor says. France and Germany benefited from the highest increase. Although most stock is still in the U.S. and the U.K., where investors' interest is mostly focused, Spain, Poland, Hungary, Portugal and the Czech Republic are also attracting attention.

1228 ET - Whirlpool won a key vote Thursday by a US government panel in its long-running trade dispute over imported washing machines made by its South Korean rivals Samsung and LG.

The 4-0 vote precedes recommendations on potential remedies for the "serious injury" Whirlpool has complained about. The decision on whether to impose tariffs or put up other trade barriers will ultimately go to President Trump. Whirlpool shares up 1% to $187.87. (andrew.tangel@wsj.com; @AndrewTangel)

1212 ET - Hey Siri, just how smart are you? A trio of Chinese researchers sought to answer that question with an IQ study of smart assistants and found that Siri's IQ was nearly half of Google Assistant. In a paper published in the Annals of Data Science, the researchers reported that Apple's assistant scored a 23.94 on an IQ test, while Google scored a 47.28 and Baidu a 32.92. All of the assistants had lower IQs than a six-year old, but the researchers found that Google and Microsoft have been getting smarter over time. It is unclear if the researchers have any links to the companies. All three have ties to the Chinese Academy of Sciences . (tripp.mickle@wsj.com)

1201 ET - Financial author John Mauldin says he agrees with what's becoming a prevalent view on oil prices: that they could be stuck in a roughly $45-$55 a barrel range for "a long, long, long time," as trigger-ready producers keep supply robust. On the sidelines of the Moneyshow conference in Dallas, Mauldin tells WSJ that every time oil gets to $50, oil and gas prospecting firms "run around all over Dallas and say 'Hey, here's my prospectus, we can make money at $50, we can give you double-digit returns on your money at $50 oil.' Then they punch a hole in the ground and they sell it forward, and that's it." (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

1153 ET - Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau says he intends to unveil the government's annual fall economic update "very soon," likely in a matter of weeks. His comments come after a meeting with the country's top private-sector economists. He's expected to take their forecasts and use them as the backbone for economic and fiscal assumptions in the update. Of his meeting, Morneau says the consensus is that the economy is in better-than-expected shape and "we will continue with a strong economic situation." Growth in Canada is expected to slow markedly in 2H, and that's evident in trade data released today indicating exports fell for a third straight month. (paul.vieira@wsj.com; @paulvieira)
