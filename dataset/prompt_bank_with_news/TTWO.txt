16:39 ET - Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) sees lower profit in FY17, citing an expected fading of interest in "Grand Theft Auto Online." The game came out in September 2013 and is tied to the fifth installment of the "Grand Theft Auto" series. "We see the results moderating in this year," Chief Executive Strauss Zelnick said. "It's natural at a certain point in time that the [game's] results would moderate." For the full year, TTW says it expects adjusted revenue of $1.5B-$1.6B, on par with 2016's haul of $1.56B. But it expects only $1-$1.25 a share in profit on an adjusted basis, down sharply from $1.96 in 2016. (sarah.needleman@wsj.com; @saraheneedleman)

16:33 ET - Cisco Systems (CSCO) generally pleased the Street with its fiscal 3Q numbers, but two weak spots stood out. Revenue from switching systems, the company's largest business, declined 3% to $3.45B in the period. In routers, the company's original business, revenue declined 5% to $1.89B. Those segments are frequently affected by the timing of Cisco's product announcements, but bears have long pointed to long-term effects from rival hardware and the rise of software-based alternatives. Cisco's shares are up 5% after-hours. (don.clark@wsj.com; @donal888)

16:26 ET - Cisco Systems' (CSCO) security unit posted a 3Q 17% revenue gain and is among the fastest growing of CSCO's businesses following an 11% gain in 2Q. Total revenue was $482M, which topped Wunderlich's $480M estimate. The brokerage had said recently released new Firepower 9300 and 4100 series security platforms helped grow sales there. Cisco is developing security platforms that it can cross-sell with servers, switches and routers. CSCO shares are up 4.8% at $28.05 in after-hours trading. (patrick.sheridan@wsj.com)

He will also donate 1.2M shares to charity, the company says. TSLA shares down 2.5% to $205.91 in late trading. (marcelo.prince@wsj.com)

16:18 ET - The sugar industry has become an "easy target" in America's fight against obesity, says Courtney Gaine, interim president and CEO the Sugar Association USA. She says a new category on food nutrition labels that requires added sugars be broken out isn't grounded in science. "Metabolically added and total sugars are the same...there's no way to know which sugars came from the milk, which sugars came from the fruit." (julie.wernau@wsj.com)

16:16 ET - Cisco Systems (CSCO) fiscal 3Q adjusted EPS and sales top Wall Street expectations and the technology giant forecasts 4Q adjusted EPS in a range of 59c-61c versus the 58 cent consensus.

CSCO shares are up 5.5% at $28.20 in after-hours trading. (patrick.sheridan@wsj.com)

16:12 ET - Oil's rise to $50 isn't likely to bring a flood of new oil and drilling, Guggenheim says. Many producers are focused more on paying down debt than growing output, and service costs are likely to rise, too, Guggenheim says. The fall in commodity prices has reshaped the industry's appetite for debt and unbridled growth. They are more likely to keep hedging long-term production and paying down debt than they are to refinance, borrow more and return to flooding the market, Guggenheim says. (tim.puko@wsj.com)

16:07 ET - US stocks reverse course to trade lower after the 2pm release of the FOMC meeting minutes that suggest the Fed is still open to raising interest rates next month. A late rally attempt, however, pushes the shares to end the session little changed. DJIA slips 3 points to 17526, the S&P 500 gains 0.42 point to 2047, while the Nasdaq rises 23 to 4739. Financials are by far the best performing sector, on hopes for higher rates, while utilities suffer as their dividends lose some appeal. The dollar is broadly higher along with Treasury yields.

15:17 ET - Ecuador was rattled by two earthquakes today while still recovering from another powerful quake last month that flattened buildings and killed hundreds of people. A magnitude-6.7 quake occurred early Wednesday and another, measured at magnitude-6.8, occurred around midday. President Rafael Correa says power was out in some coastal areas as authorities suspended classes as a precaution. State media reported minor damage to some homes and a few people were injured, but there were no immediate reports of major damage to infrastructure. Correa says there wasn't a tsunami alert and that roads and dams weren't affected. (ryan.dube@wsj.com; @duberyan)

15:13 ET - After 2015 logged the biggest difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings among S&P 500 companies since the financial crisis, Barclays says the gap for small caps "is wide by historical norms. This is somewhat worrisome because historical trends suggest that wide divergences in earnings spread are often accompanied by market pullbacks." The investment bank points out that 37% of the spread's recent increase is because of big charges recorded by energy companies. The sector makes up just 3% of the small-cap market, says Barclays. But it adds "most sectors have earnings spreads that are wider than their long-term medians" and that companies or industries with smaller spreads "significantly outperform"--especially in down markets.
