1605 ET - Some investors are wagering that stock market turbulence will continue. Options volume on the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, hit an all-time high on Friday, according to Trade Alert, as investor jitters swept through the stock market, sending major US indexes lower after hitting record highs on Thursday. The VIX index jumped higher and above 14 during the day and hovered at 11.36 in late trading as markets recovered much of their losses. At least one giant options bet exchanged hands today, which will cash in if the VIX hits 25 by this January, according to Trade Alert's Fred Ruffy. (gunjan.banerji@wsj.com; @gunjanjs)

1557 ET - Net bets on higher copper prices inched up during the week ended Tuesday, according to the latest data from the CFTC. Bullish bets by hedge funds and other speculative investors outnumbered bearish bets by 81,751 contracts, increasing less than 1% from the previous week's total of 81,072. Copper prices have pulled back from nearly three-year highs in recent sessions amid concerns that demand from China, the world's largest consumer, will slow moving forward. They are still up more than 20% for the year. (amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com; @AmrithRamkumar)

1551 ET - Net bets on higher gold prices rose 15% to their highest level in two months during the week ended Tuesday, according to data from the CFTC. Bullish bets by hedge funds and other speculative investors outnumbered bearish bets by 204,204 contracts, the most since the week ended Sept 26, when net bullish bets stood at 204,731. Gold prices touched $1,300 early in the week before retreating after economic data that analysts said should leave the Fed on track to raise interest rates in December and multiple times in 2018. Gold struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets like Treasurys as borrowing costs rise. Net bullish bets are still roughly 30% off their year-to-date highs from mid-September.

1512 ET - Saxo Bank says OPEC and non-OPEC show of unity in Vienna was a classic example of realpolitik with the economic importance of keeping prices supported outweighing fraught geopolitical relations. But "attention will now increasingly turn to the US with the market trying to gauge the impact on production growth from a price trading well above $50/b," the bank says. Weekly production estimates continue to reach new highs and during the past three weeks US drillers have added back almost half of the rigs that were pulled during the previous three months, it adds.

1457 ET - Nintendo 's latest mobile game isn't living up to analysts' expectations, data from Sensor Tower suggest. When Nintendo announced in October that its Animal Crossing franchise was coming to smartphones, analysts predicted the game would boost Nintendo 's mobile revenue, which has made up a relatively small part of the company's overall business. But Sensor Tower says "Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp" grossed only $10M in its first nine days, compared with $33M for "Fire Emblem Heroes" and $24M for "Super Mario Run" over the same period. Nintendo began making mobile apps in 2016 and now has four, including the social app "Miitomo." Other than Super Mario Run, which costs $10 to download, the company's apps are free and generate revenue from sales of virtual goods. (sarah.needleman@wsj.com; @saraheneedleman)

1439 ET - House Republicans file a bill to overturn a new regulation clamping down on payday lenders, another affront to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that came under Trump-appointee, Mick Mulvaney , this week. The lawmakers plan to use a legislative tool known as the Congressional Review Act to thwart the new rule. Today the White House appointed Brian Johnson, an aide to Rep. Jeb Hensarling, as Senior Advisor to assist Mulvaney at the CFPB. Mulvaney and Hensarling are harsh critics of the CFPB and have in the past proposed various steps to weaken the independent agency. Congress last month successfully used a CRA resolution to kill the so-called arbitration rule, which would have made it easier for consumers to sue banks. It was the first CFPB rule to be overturned by Congress. (yuka.hayashi@wsj.com; @TokyoWoods)

1419 ET - US freight operators are signaling higher shipping prices are coming as strong demand meets increasingly strained transportation supply. YRC Worldwide CEO James Welch told a Credit Suisse investor conference, "Capacity is tight. The freight environment is strong," and the less-than-truckload carrier expects to "be more aggressive" on pricing. Freight analyst group FTR said in a report that trucking companies looking to turn higher spot-market prices into stronger longer-term contract rates: "Further rate increases are on their way," FTR's Eric Starks said. YRC shares fall 0.2% as most trucking stocks pull back. (paul.page@wsj.com)

1345 ET - After sliding midday, US stocks are paring declines, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average recently down 90 points, or 0.4%, to 24180. The blue-chip index had fallen as many as 350 points earlier in the trading session after ABC News reported that former national security adviser Michael Flynn was expected to testify that President Donald Trump "directed him to make contact with the Russians." US stocks then came off their session lows, with traders attributing the recovery to both the tendency throughout the year of investors to scoop up stocks following selloffs and reports that Senate Republicans had enough votes to pass a closely-watched tax bill.

1336 ET - US regulatory approval of Mylan's biosimilar Herceptin will not only provide a sales jolt but also set the stage for the generic-drug company's to ramp up sales of complex products, according to Barclays . FDA approves Ogivri, Mylan's biosimilar version of Herceptin, on Friday for treatment of certain breast and stomach cancers. Herceptin, from Roche, has about $3B in US sales, Barclays says. The approval suggests Mylan and partner Biocon have overcome manufacturing issues that also set back approval of a biosimilar version of cancer-support drug Neulasta. Approval of such biosimilars, along with generic versions of drugs like Restasis, Estrace and Advair, would give Mylan a portfolio of "high-value" complex products that "can provide a growth bridge" for the company until US pricing pressures subside, Barclays says. Mylan shares rise 5.4%. (jonathan.rockoff@wsj.com; @jonathanrockoff)

1330 ET - US traders have brushed off concerns about a US confrontation with North Korea all year. Even the launch of a new and more powerful missile this week didn't rattle markets. An analysis by Goldman Sachs finds Trump's tweets about North Korea that reference the country or Kim Jong-un (aka Rocket Man) matter far more than missile or nuclear tests per se: "The concurrent rise in the VIX suggests that tweets alone are enough to generate market concerns. Conversely, there were several missile tests earlier this year that failed to elicit much reaction on Twitter ." (chris.dieterich@wsj.com)

1310 ET - S&P cuts Dillard's corporate credit rating, bringing the regional department store into junk territory, as concerns over the future of the retail sector continue. S&P lowers the company to BB-plus from BBB-minus. The ratings company says "the company's competitive position has weakened, reflecting the difficult backdrop for department store operators." Dillard's falls 3.4%. (austen.hufford@wsj.com; @austenhufford)
