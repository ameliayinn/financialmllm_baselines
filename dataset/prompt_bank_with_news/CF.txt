1857 ET - Evercore says there "was little concern" over MetLife 's (MET) ability to receive approval from the Delaware insurance commissioner for its spin-off of a business with a big unit in the state. Still, Evercore says the approval--made public Wednesday afternoon--is "a positive, as this represents a key hurdle being cleared for completing the spin. Additionally, we believe that delays with regards to the spin caused a modest degree of overhang on MET shares, and now with the spin officially approved by its lead regulator, we believe most of the procedural and regulatory risk has been removed."

1856 ET [Dow Jones ] Grooming products retailer Shaver Shop (SSG.AU) is on course to beat a A$14.7M Ebitda forecast for FY17 outlined in its IPO prospectus a year ago, says Ord Minnett. And if it does then it owes a big thanks to Chinese consumers. Ord Minnett says positive sales trends experienced during March and April continued through May. "It appears like-for-like sales growth has remained significantly elevated since the April update, supported by the recent surge in demand from the Chinese Daigou channel," it says. Daigou is a gray market that involves Chinese agents travelling to Australia, buying products, and then selling them in China on ecommerce platforms like Alibaba's (BABA) Taobao. Ord Minnett retains a buy call on Shaver Shop, citing an FY18 price-to-earnings ratio of 7.1 times and dividend yield of 7.1%. SSG last traded at A$0.595. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

1855 ET [Dow Jones ] Telecom company Megaport (MP1.AU) is raising equity at the right time, Canaccord Genuity says. On Wednesday, Megaport said it would raise A$27.8M by issuing shares to investors including Digital Realty (DLR). "With A$12.4M cash on hand at the end of May and cash burn of approximately A$2M-A$2.5M per month, the time was evidently right to secure funding," says Canaccord. The raising means Megaport likely has enough cash for 18 months. Also, Canaccord views the addition of Digital Realty as "a distinctly positive endorsement of Megaport's technology and its scalability." Canaccord's price target moves up 14% to A$2.40, while it stays at hold. MP1 was at A$2.25 before trading in its shares were halted pending the raising.

But the meal kit company has still generated huge returns for other, earlier investors. Venture investor Bessemer Venture Partners bought a note in Blue Apron's forerunner company that converted at $0.065 per share, according to a person familiar with the matter, and it added to its position at $0.08 per share and later at $0.22 per share. Meantime, First Round Capital also bought in at $0.08 and $0.22. Even at $10 per share, APRN is a greater than 100x return on those early investments. (rolfe.winkler@wsj.com)

1832 ET - Morgan Stanley (MS) will boost its quarterly dividend from $0.20 to $0.25/share and repurchase up to $5 billion in stock over the next year. That works out to a total capital return of about $6.8 billion, which is 103% of expected net earnings. MS is one of nine banks, out of 34 that underwent the stress tests, to crack the 100% payout ratio, per WSJ calculations. That means they are reducing, rather than adding, to their capital levels. The approval is a big win for MS, which has been under pressure from investors to boost returns. (liz.hoffman@wsj.com; @lizrhoffman)1831 EDT -- Analysts at Goldman Sachs are cutting their three month oil price forecast to $47.50 a barrel, from $55. The analysts expect prices to trade near $45 a barrel until U.S. rig counts fall, there are sustained draws from stockpiles or OPEC agrees to additional production cuts. Still, the analysts say they remain "cyclically bullish within a structurally bearish framework," noting that global inventories are drawing, OPEC can still make deeper cuts, demand is high, and it's still possible U.S. producers will be deterred by rising costs.

1830 ET - Researchers in a citizen science project called "Gravity Spy" said that more than 8,500 children and adult volunteers have sifted through data looking for "glitches," or transient noise, produced from Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors. LIGO data analysis helps in the discovery of black holes but the detectors are so sensitive that they pick up noises that are hard to separate from true gravitational-wave signals. In the "Gravity Spy" project, the wave data appears as pictures on a volunteer's computer screen. Volunteers then study the shapes and help determine if they should be classified as true signals or glitches. Researchers in many fields are increasingly turning to help from so-called citizen scientists in collecting or analyzing scientific data on a range of topics, including astronomy, protein folding, and bird sightings. Citizen scientists participating in "Gravity Spy" have so far classified two million glitches, researchers announced. (amy.marcus@wsj.com)
