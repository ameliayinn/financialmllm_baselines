"We delivered another excellent quarter of operating performance," said J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr ., Chairman, President and CEO. "We posted strong revenue growth, expanded margins, completed 6 brokerage tuck-in mergers and grew earnings per share in the quarter. During this same period, many of our clients faced challenges related to unprecedented natural disasters. I'm proud of how quickly our employees anticipated and addressed clients' needs even as many dealt with their own losses. In addition, consistent with the values of our unique Gallagher culture, others generously volunteered and contributed to relief efforts."

"Over the past month, I met with almost all of our global leaders and many insurance carriers. My discussions, and our own internal data, continue to suggest a stable global P&C rate environment. Of particular note, Australia and New Zealand are continuing to see rate increases, and it appears there could be some modest hardening on U.S. property lines. Regardless of industry conditions, our talented team will help our clients navigate the current insurance market place, and I believe we are well positioned for a strong finish to 2017, and for another excellent year in 2018."

Press Release: Arthur J. Gallagher & Co . -4-

Corporate Segment Reported GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Reconciliations (continued):

Interest and banking costs and debt - At September 30, 2017, Gallagher had $2,798.0 million of borrowings from private placements, $75.0 million of short-term borrowings under its line of credit facility and $156.4 million outstanding under a revolving loan facility that provides funding for premium finance receivables, which are fully collateralized by the underlying premiums held by insurance carriers, and as such are excluded from our debt covenant computations. Gallagher issued $398.0 million private placement debt in early August 2017 to fund the repayment of debt that matured on August 3, 2017 and reduced the credit facility balance.

Clean energy - Consists of the operating results related to our investments in 34 clean coal production plants and royalty income from clean coal licenses related to Chem-Mod LLC . Additional information regarding these results is available in the "CFO Commentary" at ajg.com/IR.

Acquisition costs - Consists mostly of external professional fees and other due diligence costs related to acquisitions.

Corporate - Consists of overhead allocations mostly related to corporate staff compensation and other corporate level activities. In the CFO commentary document as of September 15, 2017, we provided an estimate of our third quarter 2017 after-tax loss for this line ranging between $5.0 million and $6.0 million. As shown on the previous page, we actually reported a loss of $8.7 million. Most of the variance was due to unrealized losses on the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates on the remeasurement of monetary assets, net of liabilities, denominated in non-functional currencies on the balance sheets of our non-U.S. operations. As of October 25, 2017, most of that unrealized loss has reversed as the dollar has strengthened subsequent to September 30, 2017.

Litigation Settlement - During the third quarter of 2015, Gallagher settled litigation against certain former U.K. executives and their advisors for a pretax gain of $31.0 million ($22.3 million net of costs and taxes). Incremental expenses that arose in connection with this matter resulted in quarterly after-tax charges being incurred through June 30, 2017. No such charges were incurred in this segment in the third quarter of 2017.

Home Office Lease Termination/Move - During first quarter 2017, we relocated our corporate office headquarters to a nearby suburb of Chicago. Move-related after-tax charges, including after-tax lease abandonment charges, were $3.7 million in the third quarter of 2017. Move-related after-tax charges are expected to total approximately $0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Income Taxes

Gallagher allocates the provision for income taxes to its Brokerage and Risk Management segments using the local country statutory rates. Gallagher's consolidated effective tax rate for the quarters ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 was (42.5)% and (37.4)%, respectively, which was lower than the statutory rate due to the amount of IRC Section 45 tax credits earned and the impact of the income tax benefit of stock compensation in third quarter 2017.

Webcast Conference Call

Gallagher will host a webcast conference call on Thursday, October 26, 2017 at 5:15 p.m. ET/4:15 p.m. CT. To listen to this call, please go to ajg.com/IR. The call will be available for replay at such website for at least 90 days.

Gallagher's actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Readers are therefore cautioned against relying on any of the forward-looking statements, which are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following: 


   -- Risks and uncertainties related to Gallagher's clean energy investments, 
      including uncertainties related to political and regulatory risks, such 
      as potential actions by Congress or challenges by the IRS  eliminating or 
      reducing the availability of tax credits under IRC Section 45 
      retroactively and/or going forward; the ability to maintain and find 
      co-investors; the potential for divergent business objectives by 
      co-investors and other stakeholders; plant operational risks, including 
      supply-chain risks; utilities' future use of, or demand for, coal; the 
      market price of coal; the costs of moving a clean coal plant; 
      intellectual property litigation risks; and environmental risks - all of 
      which could impact (i) and (ii) above; and 
 
   -- Changes in worldwide and national economic conditions; changes in premium 
      rates and in insurance markets generally; changes in the insurance 
      brokerage industry's competitive landscape; changes in accounting 
      standards; and the uncertainties and challenges inherent in the 
      acquisition integration process - all of which could impact (iii) - (vi) 
      above. 

Please refer to Gallagher's filings with the SEC, including Item 1A, "Risk Factors," of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 for a more detailed discussion of these and other factors that could impact its forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement made by Gallagher in this press release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by applicable law, Gallagher does not undertake to update the information included herein or the corresponding earnings release posted on Gallagher's website.

Information Regarding Non-GAAP Measures

In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, this press release provides information regarding EBITDAC, EBITDAC margin, adjusted EBITDAC, adjusted EBITDAC margin, diluted net earnings per share, as adjusted (adjusted EPS), for the Brokerage and Risk Management segments, adjusted revenues, adjusted compensation and operating expenses, adjusted compensation expense ratio, adjusted operating expense ratio and organic revenue measures for each operating segment. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, the GAAP information provided in this press release. Gallagher's management believes that these presentations provide useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Gallagher's results of operations and financial condition. See further below for definitions and the reason each of these measures is useful to investors. Gallagher's industry peers may provide similar supplemental non-GAAP information with respect to one or more of these measures, although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments. The non-GAAP information provided by Gallagher should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the GAAP information provided. As disclosed in its most recent Proxy Statement, beginning in first quarter 2017, Gallagher makes determinations regarding certain elements of executive officer compensation, performance share awards and annual cash incentive awards, partly on the basis of measures related to adjusted EBITDAC. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year amounts reported in this press release in order to conform them to the current year presentation.

Adjusted Non-GAAP presentation - Gallagher believes that the adjusted non-GAAP presentations of the current and prior year information, presented in this earnings release, provide stockholders and other interested persons with useful information regarding certain financial metrics of Gallagher that may assist such persons in analyzing Gallagher's operating results as they develop a future earnings outlook for Gallagher. The after-tax amounts related to the adjustments were computed using the normalized effective tax rate for each respective period. See pages 13 and 14 for a reconciliation of the adjustments made to income taxes. 


   -- Adjusted revenues and expenses - Revenues, compensation expense and 
      operating expense, respectively, each adjusted to exclude the following: 
 
   -- Net gains realized from sales of books of business, which are primarily 
      net proceeds received related to sales of books of business and other 
      divestiture transactions. 
 
   -- Acquisition integration costs, which include costs related to certain of 
      our large acquisitions, outside the scope of our usual tuck-in strategy, 
      not expected to occur on an ongoing basis in the future once we fully 
      assimilate the applicable acquisition.  These costs are typically 
      associated with redundant workforce, extra lease space, duplicate

      services and external costs incurred to assimilate the acquisition with 
      our IT related systems. 
 
   -- Workforce related charges, which primarily include severance costs 
      related to employee terminations and other costs associated with 
      redundant workforce. 
 
   -- Lease termination related charges, which primarily include costs related 
      to terminations of real estate leases and abandonment of leased space. 
 
   -- Acquisition related adjustments, which include change in estimated 
      acquisition earnout payables adjustments, impacts of acquisition 
      valuation true-ups, impairment charges and acquisition related 
      compensation charges. 

(9 of 14) 


   -- The impact of foreign currency translation, as applicable.  The amounts 
      excluded with respect to foreign currency translation are calculated by 
      applying current year foreign exchange rates to the same periods in the 
      prior year. 
 
   -- Adjusted ratios - Adjusted compensation expense and adjusted operating 
      expense, respectively, each divided by adjusted revenues. 

Non-GAAP Earnings Measures 


   -- EBITDAC and EBITDAC margin - EBITDAC is net earnings before interest, 
      income taxes, depreciation, amortization and the change in estimated 
      acquisition earnout payables and EBITDAC margin is EBITDAC divided by 
      total revenues.  These measures for the Brokerage and Risk Management 
      segments provide a meaningful representation of Gallagher's operating 
      performance and, for the overall business, provide a meaningful way to 
      measure its financial performance on an ongoing basis. 
 
   -- Adjusted EBITDAC and Adjusted EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted EBITDAC is 
      EBITDAC adjusted to exclude net gains realized from sales of books of 
      business, acquisition integration costs, workforce related charges, lease 
      termination related charges, acquisition related adjustments and the 
      period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation, as applicable 
      and Adjusted EBITDAC margin is Adjusted EBITDAC divided by total adjusted 
      revenues (defined above).  These measures for the Brokerage and Risk 
      Management segments provide a meaningful representation of Gallagher's 
      operating performance, and are also presented to improve the 
      comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of 
      the items that have a high degree of variability. 
 
   -- Adjusted EPS for the Brokerage and Risk Management segments - Net 
      earnings adjusted to exclude the after-tax impact of net gains realized 
      from sales of books of business, acquisition integration costs, the 
      impact of foreign currency translation, workforce related charges, lease 
      termination related charges and acquisition related adjustments divided 
      by diluted weighted average shares outstanding.  This measure provides a 
      meaningful representation of Gallagher's operating performance (and as 
      such should not be used as a measure of Gallagher's liquidity), and is 
      also presented to improve the comparability of our results between 
      periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of 
      variability. 

Organic Revenues (a non-GAAP measure) - For the Brokerage segment, organic change in base commission and fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions and the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented. These commissions and fees are excluded from organic revenues in order to help interested persons analyze the revenue growth associated with the operations that were a part of Gallagher in both the current and prior year. In addition, change in base commission and fee revenue organic growth excludes the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation. For the Risk Management segment, organic change in fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of fee revenues generated from acquisitions and the fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented. In addition, change in organic growth excludes the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability or are due to the limited-time nature of these revenue sources.

These revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable, but non-GAAP, measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that are expected to continue in the current year and beyond. Gallagher has historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of its Brokerage and Risk Management segments. Gallagher also believes that using this non-GAAP measure allows readers of our financial statements to measure, analyze and compare the growth from its Brokerage and Risk Management segments in a meaningful and consistent manner.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Information Presented to GAAP Measures - This press release includes tabular reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures, as follows: for EBITDAC (on pages 11 and 12), for adjusted revenues, adjusted EBITDAC and adjusted diluted net earnings per share (on pages 2 and 3), for organic revenue measures (on pages 4 and 6, respectively, for the Brokerage and Risk Management segments), for adjusted compensation and operating expenses and adjusted EBITDAC margin (on pages 5, 6, and 7, respectively, for the Brokerage and Risk Management segments). Reported compensation and operating expense ratios can also be found in the "Supplemental Quarterly Data" available at ajg.com/IR.
