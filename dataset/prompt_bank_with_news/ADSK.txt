1542 ET - Nigeria's oil minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu sees a likely review of an extension in OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts ahead of meeting to decide on the issue Thursday.

1540 ET - The boss of Amazon 's cloud-computing unit says he doesn't expect Amazon Web Services to become an independent company. "I would be very surprised if we spun out AWS, mostly because there isn't a need to do so," AWS CEO Andy Jassy says at the cloud unit's annual conference for developers and partners today in Las Vegas. Jassy makes the comments in response to a question during a press conference. The unit, which accounts for the lion's share of Amazon 's profits, is often pegged by analysts as one that could stand on its own. In 3Q, AWS generated $4.58B in sales and $1.17 in operating profits. (jay.greene@wsj.com)

1429 ET - Federal Reserve said several districts noted increased input costs in manufacturing and transportation, and in many cases, these increases were "passed through to consumers," though the increased prices could be related to rising energy prices. Previously, there were signs businesses were paying more for the services and products they offered, but weren't passing that price jump on to consumers. Fed's beige book report could signal businesses are feeling confident enough to finally increase their pricetags. (sharon.nunn@wsj.com)

1425 ET - Retailers in the Boston district mostly cited positive growth in the Federal Reserve 's latest beige book, but a couple of retailers reported shifts in the retail environment and changing demographics. "Baby Boomers are now at ages when they spend less on consumer goods like clothing and housewares, while younger adults are more apt to shop online rather than in stores," they said. What's more, "a competitive retail environment has also taught consumers to wait for sales" like Black Friday, they said. (harriet.torry@wsj.com; @HarrietTorry)

1422 ET - The Federal Reserve says residential real estate activity "remained constrained, with most districts reporting little growth in sales or construction." This is bad news for housing-market enthusiasts, but even worse for those looking for a home in already construction-starved but competitive markets. In recent months, lackluster homebuilding has led to a run-up in home prices, potentially pricing many out of the market and causing several housing-related economic indicators to decelerate. Add to that a further slowing of home construction and you have a recipe for surging home prices, if demand keeps up. (sharon.nunn@wsj.com)
