Fitch Ratings-New York-13 November 2017: Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of 'BBB' to Republic Services, Inc .'s (RSG) proposed $650 million senior notes due 2027. RSG intends to use the proceeds to repay amounts borrowed under its unsecured credit facilities, in addition to general corporate purposes.

Fitch currently rates RSG's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured debt 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Positive. The ratings cover approximately $8 billion of debt as of June 30, 2017. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

The Positive Outlook is supported by RSG's second largest market position within the environmental services sector, stable credit metrics, constructive industry dynamics, and demonstrated consistent focus on its core business. RSG has exhibited consistently high profitability levels for over a decade including during significant residential housing, commercial and industrial downturns. Further supporting RSG's rating outlook is its defensive position in an ever-consolidating industry. RSG benefits from roughly 60% of its revenue is derived from either franchise/exclusive or small and mid-size markets where it maintains considerable pricing power and or limited competition.

Fitch believes that the risk profile of the waste services industry has materially decreased in recent years. The industry as a whole has become more disciplined with respect to its core solid waste operations; largely shedding ancillary ventures which have historically been less productive from a capital efficiency standpoint. The industry has begun to utilize big data in its continued focus on pricing discipline, with a demonstrated willingness to shed low-margin legacy business. In addition, the industry has made collective gains with an increased focus on higher-quality indexing or inflation adjustments in customer contracts. Fitch believes that increased consolidation, largely driven by tuck-in acquisitions of the roughly 35% of the U.S. and Canadian market that remains closely held, provides considerable runway for acquisitive growth. Fitch further assesses that the relatively limited wallet share (for both commercial and residential customers) that the industry represents further underpins continued pricing power.

Through the second quarter of 2017 (2Q17), the company has generated revenue growth of roughly 5% on a latest 12 months (LTM) basis which compares favorably to revenue gains of 3% and 3.5% in fiscal year (FY) 2016 and FY2015 respectively. Recent revenue gains are attributed to increased average yield, recycled commodity volumes, greater volumes and fuel recovery fees and acquisitions. The change in revenue is primarily due to increases in average yield of 2.4%, recycled commodities of 1.8% and volume of 1.5% during the six months ended June 30, 2017.

Through 2Q17, RSG generated 28.3% EBITDA margins on a LTM basis. This compares to the 28.5% and 28.9% margins generated in FY2016 and FY2015, respectively. In 2016, RSG realigned its field support functions by combining its three regions into two field groups, consolidating service areas and streamlining operational support roles at its headquarters. The company also consolidated over 100 customer service support locations and Fitch expects the company's restructuring efforts to continue through 2017. Fitch expects RSG to generate roughly 28% EBITDA margins for FY2017 and for margins to continue to expand toward 30% over the medium term.

Rating concerns include the company's exposure to the more volatile petroleum exploration and production (E&P) sector, somewhat volatile recycling commodity revenues, frequent acquisition activity and the potential for a significant increase in shareholder-friendly activities. Concerns also include the potential for significant cash costs related to environmental clean-up at landfills or a material shift in the firm's financial strategy.

Through 2Q17, RSG generated $540 million of free cash flow (FCF; post-dividend) on a LTM basis, up from roughly $500 million and $334 million in FY2016 and FY2015 respectively. Fitch notes that FCF advances have been driven by operational improvements while capital intensity and working capital needs have largely remained consistent during this period. Fitch expects RSG's FY2017 FCF margin to be roughly 6%, up from 5.3% and 3.7% in FY2016 and FY2015 respectively.

Through 2Q17, RSG had total adjusted debt/EBITDAR of 3.0x on a LTM basis, which has been flat since FY2015. Through 2Q17, the company's total debt/EBITDA was 2.9x, which has also been flat since FY2015. Fitch expects the company's leverage metrics to largely remain within this range and does not expect the company's total adjusted debt/EBITDAR to rise above 3.0x for a significant period of time in the medium term.

DERIVATION SUMMARY

RSG compares favorably to its peer, Waste Management and Waste Connections , as the second largest firm by market share in the environmental services sector. The company's leverage metrics have remained consistent with adjusted debt/EBITDAR at roughly 3.0x in recent years. FCF levels have improved in recent years largely driven by operational improvements and opportunistic, high-quality revenue growth.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include:

--Low single-digit revenue growth through the medium term;

--EBITDA margins of at least 28% through the medium term;

--Capital expenditures of roughly $975 million in FY2017;

--Dividends of roughly $450 million in FY2017;

--Share repurchases of roughly $450 million in FY2017;

--Tuck-in acquisitions of roughly $100 million in FY2017.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action

--A change to a more conservative financial strategy;

--FCF margin consistently greater than 4%;

--Maintaining total adjusted debt/EBITDAR below 2.5x for a prolonged period.

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action

--A change to a less conservative financial strategy;

--FCF margin consistently lower than 2%;

--Maintaining total adjusted debt/EBITDAR above 3.25x for a prolonged period;

--Debt funded shareholder-friendly activity.

LIQUIDITY

RSG continues to maintain adequate liquidity. As of the end of 2Q17, the company had $36 million in cash and $1.6 billion in revolver capacity ($2.25 billion less drawings and letters of credit). In addition to its strong liquidity, the company has no major debt maturities in the near future. RSG's two primary revolving credit facilities do not mature until 2019 and 2021 with none of its unsecured notes maturing prior to 2018.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitchâ tms factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitchâ tms ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.
