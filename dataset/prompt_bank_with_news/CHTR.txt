1021 ET - A blackout of Viacom Inc . channels like Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central on Charter Communications Inc .'s Spectrum cable service has been averted for the time being, as both companies have announced an "agreement in principle" on Tuesday evening. " Spectrum subscribers will continue to have access to Viacom 's networks, without disruption, while we finalize terms," the companies said in a joint statement. Viacom had earlier said that it had offered a package that would let Spectrum's 16.5 million subscribers pay less for its channels. Their last distribution agreement expired on Sunday. Viacom shares slip 1.6% and Charter loses 0.4%. (keach.hagey@wsj.com)

1013 ET - Encana , a Canadian oil and gas company that produces in the Permian basin and elsewhere, outlined a five-year plan for investors in which it will generate free cash flow by 2019 and generate a return on capital of 10% to 15% by 2022. Production growth will range between 10% and 15%, and debt will be only two times greater than operating earnings by next year. That mix of generating free cash flow, growing production and returns has been elusive for most shale companies over the last several years, but investors are beginning to demand changes. Encana appears to be on target or moving ahead of schedule on a number of its targets, according to Tudor Pickering Holt. (bradley.olson@wsj.com; @bradnews)

1004 ET - Hurricane Maria had a "modest" effect on medical-products maker Abbott Laboratories ' manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico, CEO Miles White tells analysts on 3Q earnings call. "Our first priority was to find all our people and to aid them, which we've done," he said. "The biggest issue was access to power generation in Puerto Rico, and our folks addressed that really rapidly. Our plants are back up and running." Abbott makes vascular and other products on the island. (peter.loftus@wsj.com; @Loftus)

1003 ET - Embraer, facing a potential squeeze if the planned Airbus-Bombardier pact is sealed, is quietly moving on with the business of producing jetliners. The company says it's new E190-E2 regional jet will be delivered to launch customer Wideroe next April. That's the mid-point of Embraer's targeted first-half-of-2018, notable given the late arrival of many rival new jet models. (doug.cameron@wsj.com; @dougcameron)

0956 ET - Investors aren't expecting eye-popping results when the world's top grain-trading companies report quarterly results at the end of October, and JPMorgan analysts sympathize. US grain export volumes have sunk versus last year's high levels, though soybean processing margins have been relatively good; in South America, crop shipments have surged, but processing margins look weak, JPMorgan says. That mixed picture has kept shares of Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge behind the broader US equity market, and while 2018 is too early to call, "we continue to view the risks as skewed to the downside," JPMorgan says.

0950 ET - BHP Billiton expects oil demand will continue to rise for a few years from today's needs of nearly 100M barrels per day, but expects it to peak sometime in the mid-2030s around 110M barrels a day. Even so, natural decline rates in old oil fields mean the world will need around an extra 35M barrels a day of new supply to offset what gets pumped out of the ground, said Steve Pastor , President of Petroleum for BHP, at the Oil & Money conference in London. That requires enormous investment because it's essentially replacing one-third of today's global crude supply, he says, adding that this ensures oil companies won't become irrelevant. "We believe natural decline and a steep cost curve will create attractive investment opportunities in oil, well into the middle of this century," he says. (lynn.cook@wsj.com; @LynnJCook)

0945 ET - Deepwater projects can be pulled off for a lot less money and make economic sense in the age of shale, according to Steve Pastor , president of Petroleum for BHP Billiton. While speaking at the Oil & Money conference in London, Pastor says BHP and its partners sanctioned Mad Dog Phase 2 in the Gulf of Mexico with a price tag half its original. Mad Dog's cost is now around $9B, down from $20B a few years ago. This will allow "one of the biggest discovered undeveloped oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico to be profitably developed, well below today's prices," Pastor says. The company achieved this by using more existing infrastructure to minimize development costs and plans to tap smaller satellite fields faster so they can generate profits faster than traditional deepwater plans normally call for.

0938 ET - BHP is trying to get out of US shale and refocus on deepwater drilling. The company did not fully appreciate the enormous supply of low cost gas to be unlocked by shale drillers, "including ourselves," Steve Pastor , President of Petroleum for BHP Billiton, tells a London audience at the Oil & Money Conference. Even though BHP has some sweet spots in Texas shale plays, with breakevens below $50 a barrel, it doesn't see the assets as big enough or with a long enough reserve life to make sense for its portfolio. "We simply don't see U.S. shale oil as the marginal, price-setting barrel in our global market beyond the early to mid-2020s," he says. (lynn.cook@wsj.com; @LynnJCook)

0919 ET - September housing starts were down 4.7% from the previous month and housing permits, a measure of future home building, was also down, declining 4.5% from August. The numbers do not bode well, at least temporarily, for those in the construction sector hoping to see builders ramp up projects in the wake of increased demand and rising prices that are beginning to price some home buyers out of the market. Recent hurricane activity could have affected this month's reading, but housing starts were already down five of the last six months. (Sharon.Nunn@WSJ.com)

0908 ET - US government bond prices fell overnight, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note rising to 2.341%, according to Tradeweb , compared with 2.300% on Tuesday. Yields have risen throughout the month as investors have increasingly bet that the Federal Reserve will raise rates once more in December and analysts have eyed the potential that, at the end of her term, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen could be replaced by a more hawkish chair. President Donald Trump , who said earlier in the week that he has narrowed the search to five candidates, including Yellen, is expected to make a decision on the Fed leadership before an upcoming trip to Asia in November.

0835 ET - M&T Bank 's 3Q profit fell far short of analysts' expectations as the company's loan growth and noninterest income both fell. Total loans and leases fell 2% largely because of a 14% drop in real-estate loans to consumers. Noninterest income also fell 6% in the quarter. The Buffalo, NY, bank's EPS came in at $2.21 while analysts expected $2.40. Shares were down 1.2% in premarket trading on low volume. (allison.prang@wsj.com; @AllisonPrang)
