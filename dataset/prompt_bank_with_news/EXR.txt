After Hurricanes

Average self-storage rents increased 0.9% in the third quarter from the same period a year earlier, partly because of stronger demand from areas affected recently by hurricanes, according to data from research firm Green Street Advisors.

"It is safe to assume that occupancies in hurricane-impacted markets, although difficult to measure with precision, are now nicely higher," said Green Street.

The boost in demand managed to offset somewhat the impact of a boom in construction activity that has weighed on rents in many markets across the country, especially in Houston before Hurricane Harvey.

CubeSmart recorded average rent growth of 2.3% in the quarter. Rents in Extra Space Storage Inc. and Public Storage rose an average of 0.2% and 1.3%, respectively.

Average rents at Life Storage Inc. fell 1.5%. Life Storage earlier said it would keep its rate and leasing incentives unchanged in Houston and Florida and added that it already had a strong occupancy rate of about 92% in Houston before Harvey.

According to SpareFoot.com, a marketplace for storage facilities across the country, there had been a spike in demand for new rentals after the recent hurricanes in affected areas but it has now petered out.

Customers in storm-battered areas are likely to keep their boxes for a longer time than they initially anticipate, said Chuck Gordon, chief executive officer of SpareFoot. That would benefit places like Houston for the long term, but not enough to warrant more development projects.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Website for Pop-Ups

Secures Funding

A venture-capital firm that focuses on real-estate technology is investing in a London startup that has created an online marketplace for pop-up stores.

Fifth Wall Ventures, which is backed by big names in the real-estate world like Hines, CBRE Group Inc. and Macerich Co., has made a significant investment in Appear Here, said Brendan Wallace, Fifth Wall's managing partner. He declined to specify an amount or how much of a stake Fifth Wall is taking.

Founded in 2013, Appear Here has hooked up thousands of retailers with landlords in London and other U.K. cities. Its website includes more than 100,000 brands looking for space. The company, which enables retailers to sign leases for days or months, also has expanded to Paris and New York.

Pop-up stores selling seasonal goods like Halloween costumes have existed for years. But numerous online marketplaces have been launched to make it easier for tenants and landlords to find each other.

"We've standardized the process, which used to take six months, and made it take 48 hours," said Ross Bailey, Appear Here's founder and CEO.
