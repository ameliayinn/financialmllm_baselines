CHARLOTTE, N.C., Nov. 15, 2017

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Nov. 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) announced today that it will build a full-range merchant bar quality (MBQ) mill at its existing bar steel mill located in Bourbonnais, Illinois. The MBQ mill will have an annual capacity of 500,000 tons and is expected to cost $180 million. The project will take approximately two years to complete.

"This new MBQ mill is right in line with our long-term strategy for profitable growth. It takes advantage of our position as a low-cost producer to displace tons currently being supplied by competitors outside the region. It also builds on our market leadership position by further enhancing our product offerings of merchant bar, light shapes and structural angle and channel in markets in the central U.S.," said John Ferriola , Chairman, CEO & President of Nucor. "Combined with our other full-range bar mills, we are now strategically located to supply all markets with high-quality bar products and exceptional service."

The Midwest region is one of the largest markets for MBQ products, and Nucor is ideally situated to take advantage of existing operating and commercial capabilities to meet this regional demand. This project will allow Nucor to fully utilize the Company's existing bar mill by optimizing its melt capacity and infrastructure that is already in place. It will also take advantage of an abundant scrap supply in the region, as well as the Company's commercial footprint in the central United States. Nucor Steel Kankakee, Inc. will continue to be a supplier of quality reinforcing bar products.

"We are very excited to bring new investment and jobs to the Kankakee community and the State of Illinois," said Johnny Jacobs, Vice President & General Manager of Nucor Steel Kankakee. "We would like to thank Governor Rauner, state and local officials, our teammates and the entire community for their support of this project. Nucor 's bar mills have been a cornerstone of our company and, as this project demonstrates, they are an important part of Nucor 's future."
