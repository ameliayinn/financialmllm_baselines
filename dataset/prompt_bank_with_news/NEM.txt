Outlook

Newmont's outlook reflects stable gold production and ongoing investment in its operating assets and most promising growth prospects. Newmont does not include development projects that have not yet been funded or reached execution stage in its outlook which represents upside to guidance.

Attributable gold production is expected to improve to between 4.9 and 5.4 million ounces in 2018, compared to previous 2018 guidance mainly driven by Full Potential mine plan, throughput and recovery improvements. Production is expected to be between 4.9 and 5.4 million ounces in 2019 and longer term production is expected to remain stable at between 4.6 and 5.1 million ounces per year through 2022 excluding development projects which have yet to be approved. 


   -- North America production is expected to be between 2.0 and 2.2 million 
      ounces in 2018 with production from Northwest Exodus, Twin Underground 
      and the Silverstar pit offsetting higher stripping at Carlin and Twin 
      Creeks and lower grade ore at CC&V. Production declines slightly in 2019 
      to between 1.8 and 2.0 million ounces due to planned stripping at Carlin 
      and then increases to between 1.9 and 2.1 million ounces in 2020 due to 
      higher grades at Twin Creeks, CC&V and Long Canyon. The Company continues 
      to pursue profitable growth opportunities at Carlin and Long Canyon. 
 
   -- South America production is expected to be between 615,000 and 675,000 
      ounces in 2018 as Merian delivers mine and mill productivity improvements 
      that partially offset Yanacocha's lower production resulting from lower 
      grades and recoveries from deep transitional ore. Production is expected 
      to be between 590,000 and 690,000 ounces in 2019 with the addition of 
      Quecher Main and between 475,000 and 575,000 ounces per year in 2020 as 
      Yanacocha laybacks are mined out and Merian transitions from saprolite to 
      hard rock. The Company continues to advance near-mine growth 
      opportunities at Merian and both oxide and sulfide potential at 
      Yanacocha. 
 
   -- Australia production is expected to be between 1.5 and 1.7 million ounces 
      in 2018 due to higher grade, recovery and throughput improvements at 
      Tanami and KCGM which offset increased stripping at Boddington. 
      Production is expected to be between 1.4 and 1.6 million ounces in 2019 
      and 2020. In 2020, Boddington completes stripping and accesses higher 
      grade ore which offsets the impact of processing lower grade stockpiles 
      at KCGM. The Company continues to advance studies for a second expansion 
      at Tanami. 
 
   -- Africa production is expected to be between 815,000 and 875,000 ounces in 
      2018 as Full Potential mining improvements at the Subika open pit and a 
      full year of Subika underground production offset the effects of harder, 
      lower grade ore at Akyem. Production is expected to be between 1.1 and 
      1.2 million ounces in 2019 as the Ahafo Mill expansion reaches commercial 
      production and between 880,000 and 980,000 ounces in 2020 as both Ahafo 
      and Akyem reach lower open pit grade. The company continues to advance 
      the Ahafo North project and other prospective surface and underground 
      opportunities. 

Gold cost outlook -- CAS is expected to improve to between $700 and $750 per ounce for 2018 compared to previous 2018 guidance following production increases in North America and Africa and Full Potential cost and efficiency improvements across the portfolio. CAS is expected to be between $620 and $720 per ounce for 2019 and between $650 and $750 per ounce longer term through 2022. AISC is expected to improve to between $965 and $1,025 per ounce in 2018 compared to previous 2018 guidance as improved CAS offsets increases in exploration and advanced projects spend. AISC is expected to be between $870 and $970 per ounce in 2019 and longer-term through 2022. Further Full Potential savings and profitable ounces from projects that are not yet approved represent additional upside not currently captured in guidance. 


   -- North America CAS is expected to improve to between $760 and $810 per 
      ounce compared to previous 2018 guidance with Full Potential efficiency 
      and cost improvements. CAS is expected to be between $680 and $780 per 
      ounce in 2019 and between $655 and $755 per ounce in 2020 on higher 
      production at Twin Creeks, CC&V and Long Canyon. AISC is expected to 
      improve to between $945 and $1,020 per ounce in 2018 on improved unit 
      CAS. AISC is expected to be between $870 and $970 per ounce in 2019 and 
      between $825 and $925 in 2020. 
 
   -- South America CAS is expected to rise to between $705 and $765 per ounce 
      compared to previous 2018 guidance due to lower production and increased 
      costs from processing deeper transitional ore at Yanacocha. CAS is 
      expected to improve to between $560 and $660 per ounce in 2019 as Quecher 
      Main reaches commercial production and be between $690 and $790 per ounce 
      in 2020. AISC is expected to rise to between $945 and $1,045 per ounce in 
      2018 on higher unit CAS and increased sustaining capital for additional 
      haul trucks at Merian. AISC is expected to improve to between $810 and 
      $910 per ounce in 2019 on improved unit CAS and be between $970 and 
      $1,070 per ounce in 2020. 
 
   -- Australia CAS is expected to improve slightly to between $675 and $725 
      per ounce compared to previous 2018 guidance with Full Potential mine 
      plan, throughput and recovery improvements. CAS is expected to be between 
      $670 and $770 per ounce in 2019 and 2020. AISC is expected to improve to 
      between $830 and $890 per ounce in 2018 on improved unit CAS. AISC is 
      expected to be between $840 and $940 per ounce in 2019 and 2020. The 
      Company expects to reach a decision on the Tanami Power project by the 
      end of 2017 which could deliver additional cost savings not currently 
      included in guidance. 
 
   -- Africa CAS is expected to improve to between $680 and $730 per ounce 
      compared to previous 2018 guidance with Full Potential mine plan,

      throughput and recovery improvements. CAS is expected to be between $520 
      and $620 per ounce in 2019 and between $610 and $710 per ounce in 2020. 
      AISC is expected to improve to between $865 and $925 per ounce in 2018 as 
      Subika Underground reaches commercial production. AISC is expected to be 
      between $700 and $800 per ounce in 2019 as the Ahafo Mill expansion 
      reaches commercial production and between $775 and $875 per ounce in 
      2020. 

Copper -- Attributable production is expected to remain between 40,000 and 60,000 tonnes in 2018 and 2019, increasing to between 45,000 and 65,000 tonnes longer term through 2022 as Phoenix moves into higher copper zones. CAS is expected to rise to between $1.65 and $1.85 per pound in 2018 compared to previous 2018 guidance due to lower grades at Boddington and increasing costs at Phoenix as the mine plan focuses on gold producing zones. CAS is expected to be between $1.80 and $2.20 per pound in 2019 before falling to between $1.40 and $1.80 per pound longer term as Phoenix moves into higher copper zones. AISC is expected to rise to between $2.00 and $2.20 per pound in 2018 on increased unit CAS. AISC is expected to be between $2.25 and $2.55 per pound in 2019 and between $1.80 and $2.10 per pound longer term.

Capital -- Total capital is expected to remain at between $900 and $1,000 million for 2018 and increase in 2019 to between $730 and $830 million compared to previous guidance with the addition of Quecher Main offset by sustaining capital savings across the portfolio. Primary development capital includes expenditure on the Ahafo Mill and Subika Underground expansions in Africa, Twin Underground in North America and Quecher Main in South America. Sustaining capital is expected to be between $600 and $700 million in 2018, between $600 and $700 million for 2019 and between $550 and $650 million per year longer term to cover infrastructure, equipment and ongoing mine development.

Consolidated expense outlook -- Interest expense for 2018 is expected to decrease to between $175 and $215 million due to lower debt balances while investment in exploration and advanced projects is expected to increase to between $350 and $400 million. 2018 outlook for general & administrative costs remains unchanged at between $215 and $240 million and guidance for depreciation and amortization remains unchanged at between $1,225 and $1,325 million.

Assumptions and sensitivities -- Newmont's outlook assumes $1,200 per ounce gold price, $2.50 per pound copper price, $0.75 USD/AUD exchange rate and $55 per barrel WTI oil price. A $100 per ounce increase in gold price would deliver an expected $335 million improvement in attributable free cash flow. Similarly, a $10 per barrel reduction in the price of oil and a $0.05 favorable change in the Australian dollar would deliver an expected $25 million and $45 million improvement in attributable free cash flow, respectively. These estimates exclude current hedge programs; please refer to Newmont's Form 10-Q which was filed with the SEC on October 26, 2017 for further information on hedging positions.

Projects update 


   -- Subika Underground (Africa) leverages existing infrastructure and an 
      optimized approach to develop Ahafo's most promising underground 
      resource. First production was achieved in June 2017 with commercial 
      production expected in the second half of 2018. The project is expected 
      to increase average annual gold production by between 150,000 and 200,000 
      ounces per year for the first five years beginning in 2019 with an 
      initial mine life of approximately 11 years. Capital costs for the 
      project are estimated at between $160 and $200 million with expenditure 
      of between $80 and $90 million in 2018. The project has an IRR of more 
      than 20 percent at a $1,200 gold price. 
 
   -- Ahafo Mill Expansion (Africa) is designed to maximize resource value by 
      improving production margins and accelerating stockpile processing. The 
      project also supports profitable development of Ahafo's highly 
      prospective underground resource. First production is expected in the 
      first half of 2019 with commercial production expected in the second half 
      of 2019. The expansion is expected to increase average annual gold 
      production by between 75,000 and 100,000 ounces per year for the first 
      five years beginning in 2020. Capital costs for the project are estimated 
      at between $140 and $180 million with expenditure of approximately $75 to 
      $85 million in 2018. The project has an IRR of more than 20 percent at a 
      $1,200 gold price.Together the Ahafo expansion projects (Ahafo Mill 
      Expansion and Subika Underground) improve Ahafo's production to between 
      550,000 and 650,000 ounces per year for the first five full years of 
      production (2020--2024). During this period Ahafo's CAS is expected to be 
      between $650 and $750 per ounce and All-in sustaining cost is expected to 
      be between $800 and $900 per ounce. This represents average production 
      improvement of between 200,000 and 300,000 ounces at CAS improvement of 
      between $150 and $250 per ounce and AISC improvement of $250 to $350 per 
      ounce, compared to 2016 actuals. 
 
   -- Twin Underground (North America) is a portal mine beneath Twin Creek's 
      Vista surface mine with similar mineralization. First production was 
      achieved in August 2017 with commercial production expected mid-2018. The 
      expansion is expected to average between 30,000 and 40,000 ounces per 
      year for the first five years (2018 to 2022). During this period CAS is 
      expected to be between $525 and $625 per ounce and AISC between $650 and 
      $750 per ounce. Capital costs are expected to be between $45 and $55 
      million with expenditure of $15 to $25 million in 2018. The project IRR 
      is expected to be about 20 percent at a $1,200 gold price. 
 
   -- Quecher Main (South America) will add oxide production at Yanacocha, 
      leverage existing infrastructure and enable potential future growth at 
      Yanacocha. First production is expected in early 2019 with commercial 
      production in the fourth quarter of 2019. Quecher Main extends the life 
      of the Yanacocha operation to 2027 with average annual gold production of 
      approximately 200,000 ounces per year between 2020 and 2025 (100 percent 
      basis). During the same period incremental CAS is expected to be between 
      $750 and $850 per ounce and AISC between $900 and $1,000 per ounce. 
      Capital costs for the project are expected to be between $250 and $300 
      million with expenditure of $80 to $90 million in 2018. The project IRR 
      is expected to be greater than 10 percent at a $1,200 gold price.

------------------------------------   -----       ----- 
 
 
(a)    2018 Outlook in the table above are considered "forward-looking 
       statements" and are based upon certain assumptions, including, but not 
       limited to, metal prices, oil prices, certain exchange rates and other 
       assumptions. For example, 2018 Outlook assumes $1,200/oz Au, $2.50/lb 
       Cu, $0.75 USD/AUD exchange rate and $55/barrel WTI; AISC and CAS 
       estimates do not include inflation, for the remainder of the year. 
       Production, CAS, AISC and capital estimates exclude projects that have 
       not yet been approved. The potential impact on inventory valuation as a 
       result of lower prices, input costs, and project decisions are not 
       included as part of this Outlook. Such assumptions may prove to be 
       incorrect and actual results may differ materially from those 
       anticipated. See cautionary note at the end of the release. 
(b)    All-in sustaining costs or AISC as used in the Company's Outlook is a 
       non-GAAP metric defined as the sum of costs applicable to sales 
       (including all direct and indirect costs related to current production 
       incurred to execute on the current mine plan), reclamation costs 
       (including operating accretion and amortization of asset retirement 
       costs), G&A, exploration expense, advanced projects and R&D, treatment 
       and refining costs, other expense, net of one-time adjustments and 
       sustaining capital. See reconciliation at the end of this release. 
(c)    Includes Lone Tree operations. 
(d)    Includes TRJV operations. 
(e)    Consolidated production for Yanacocha and Merian is presented on a 
       total production basis for the mine site; attributable production 
       represents a 51.35% interest for Yanacocha and a 75% interest for 
       Merian. 
(f)    Both consolidated and attributable production are shown on a pro-rata 
       basis with a 50% ownership for Kalgoorlie. 
(g)    Production outlook does not include equity production from stakes in 
       TMAC (28.8%) or La Zanja (46.94%). 
(h)    Consolidated expense outlook is adjusted to exclude extraordinary 
       items. For example, the tax rate outlook above is a consolidated 
       adjusted rate, which assumes the exclusion of certain tax valuation 
       allowance adjustments. 
 
 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, we present the Non-GAAP financial measures of our continuing operations in the tables below.

Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound

Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales of gold and copper by gold ounces or copper pounds sold, respectively. These measures are calculated for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.

All-In Sustaining Costs

Newmont has worked to develop a metric that expands on GAAP measures, such as cost of goods sold, and non-GAAP measures, such as Costs applicable to sales per ounce, to provide visibility into the economics of our mining operations related to expenditures, operating performance and the ability to generate cash flow from our continuing operations.

Current GAAP-measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain production. Therefore, we believe that all-in sustaining costs is a non-GAAP measure that provides additional information to management, investors and analysts that aid in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and in the investor's visibility by better defining the total costs associated with production.

All-in sustaining cost ("AISC") amounts are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks such as in International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"), or by reflecting the benefit from selling non-gold metals as a reduction to AISC. Differences may also arise related to definitional differences of sustaining versus development capital activities based upon each company's internal policies.

The following disclosure provides information regarding the adjustments made in determining the all-in sustaining costs measure:

Costs applicable to sales. Includes all direct and indirect costs related to current production incurred to execute the current mine plan. We exclude certain exceptional or unusual amounts from Costs applicable to sales ("CAS"), such as significant revisions to recovery amounts. CAS includes by-product credits from certain metals obtained during the process of extracting and processing the primary ore-body. CAS is accounted for on an accrual basis and excludes Depreciation and amortization and Reclamation and remediation, which is consistent with our presentation of CAS on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In determining AISC, only the CAS associated with producing and selling an ounce of gold is included in the measure. Therefore, the amount of gold CAS included in AISC is derived from the CAS presented in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations less the amount of CAS attributable to the production of copper at our Phoenix and Boddington mines. The copper CAS at those mine sites is disclosed in Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines is based upon the relative sales value of gold and copper produced during the period.

Reclamation costs. Includes accretion expense related to Asset Retirement Obligation ("ARO") and the amortization of the related Asset Retirement Cost ("ARC") for the Company's operating properties. Accretion related to the ARO and the amortization of the ARC assets for reclamation does not reflect annual cash outflows but are calculated in accordance with GAAP. The accretion and amortization reflect the periodic costs of reclamation associated with current production and are therefore included in the measure. The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines.

Advanced projects, research and development and exploration. Includes incurred expenses related to projects that are designed to increase or enhance current production and exploration. We note that as current resources are depleted, exploration and advanced projects are necessary for us to replace the depleting reserves or enhance the recovery and processing of the current reserves. As this relates to sustaining our production, and is considered a continuing cost of a mining company, these costs are included in the AISC measure. These costs are derived from the Advanced projects, research and development and Exploration amounts presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations less the amount attributable to the production of copper at our Phoenix and Boddington mines. The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines.

General and administrative. Includes costs related to administrative tasks not directly related to current production, but rather related to support our corporate structure and fulfill our obligations to operate as a public company. Including these expenses in the AISC metric provides visibility of the impact that general and administrative activities have on current operations and profitability on a per ounce basis.

Other expense, net. We exclude certain exceptional or unusual expenses from Other expense, net, such as restructuring, as these are not indicative to sustaining our current operations. Furthermore, this adjustment to Other expense, net is also consistent with the nature of the adjustments made to Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders as disclosed in the Company's non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted net income (loss). The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines.

Treatment and refining costs. Includes costs paid to smelters for treatment and refining of our concentrates to produce the salable metal. These costs are presented net as a reduction of Sales on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Sustaining capital. We determined sustaining capital as those capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. Capital expenditures to develop new operations, or related to projects at existing operations where these projects will enhance production or reserves, are generally considered development. We determined the classification of sustaining and development capital projects based on a systematic review of our project portfolio in light of the nature of each project. Sustaining capital costs are relevant to the AISC metric as these are needed to maintain the Company's current operations and provide improved transparency related to our ability to finance these expenditures from current operations. The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines.

AISC outlook is also a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of the 2018 Gold AISC outlook range to the 2018 CAS outlook range is provided below. The estimates in the table below are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws.

       result, the total All-in sustaining costs and the All-in sustaining 
       costs per ounce may not sum to the component ranges. While a 
       reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure has been 
       provided for 2018 AISC Gold Outlook on a consolidated basis, a 
       reconciliation has not been provided on an individual site-by-site 
       basis or for longer-term outlook in reliance on Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of 
       Regulation S-K because such reconciliation is not available without
