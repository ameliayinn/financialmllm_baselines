Separately, the same group of experts also want NASA to ramp up research on topics promoting commercial drones, including development of new air-traffic control networks and autonomous flights over people. Their long-term goal is to "ensure all forms of aviation will be as safe as commercial air transport is today." (andy.pasztor@wsj.com)

1640 ET - The Canadian dollar was slightly lower Friday, moving in a sideways range for much of the day as the currency consolidates its moves in end-of-week trading. The USD was recently at C$1.2864 from C$1.2854 late Thursday, according to CQG. The Canadian dollar closed near a new six-week low against the greenback, days after the Bank of Canada 's relatively dovish tone on the Canadian economy. While there was no major domestic data released on Friday, the loonie shrugged off the broader market that saw better-than-expected US labor figures drive sentiment.

1607 ET - With Moscow preparing to stress the importance of international cooperation for space exploration efforts in low-Earth orbit and on the lunar surface, Russian officials are reeling from another satellite launch failure. A weather satellite and 18 smaller satellites were lost after a November blastoff, following more than a handful of previous botched Russian launches in recent years. But Moscow is expected to sign on to a revised international strategy, slated to be unveiled early next year, highlighting programs in low-Earth orbit. Drafted by Russia, the US and other international space station partners, the document also will emphasize moon missions and advantages of NASA 's proposed crewed platform, called Deep Space Gateway.

1555 ET - The National Grocers Association is appealing to Congress to do more to create an even playing field between the tax bill's treatment of pass-through businesses and big corporations. The membership organization of independent supermarkets, many operating as pass-through entities, writes that the Senate bill has improved the tax rates charged to the entities, but its sunset provision creates too much uncertainty. The bill's language also could prevent trusts and estates from being eligible for the pass-through deduction, it writes. "NGA member companies are American, family-owned companies that do not have the tax advantage of offshore profit shifting," the organization writes in the letter Friday. "It is critical that Congress ensure a level playing field for all businesses involved." (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)

1514 ET - Shares of Cooper Cos remain under heavy selling pressure with Wall Street underwhelmed by a slower-than-expected growth rate in the company's US contact lens business, where JPMorgan points out the primary weakness was in daily disposables. Raymond James is also acknowledging that Americas growth was "weak" but points out that it was up against difficult comps from the year-ago quarter. Analysts also point to uncertainty over what tax reform will mean for the company. Raymond James says the forced repatriation of foreign profits could add up to a $200M-$250M tax bill. Cooper Companies off 6% to $224.59. (patrick.sheridan@wsj.com)

1259 ET - Boeing bites the bullet and concedes it won't be selling new F/A-18 jets to Canada, which is opting for used ones acquired from Australia in retaliation for the US company's campaign against Bombardier. Boeing still takes the opportunity to have a dig at Lockheed Martin , which retains hope of eventually selling its F-35 to Canada, applauding the government's choice of a "two-engine fighter solution." The F-35 is a single-engine jet. (doug.cameron@wsj.com; @dougcameron)

1233 ET - Natural gas imports into China are soaring as the country tries to back off coal use. Chinese customs data for November show gas imports reached 6.9 Bcm, up 42% from last year and up almost 13% on a month-on-month basis, according to Barclays . November coal imports showed a slight 3.6% month-on-month gain but were down 18% compared to the same month of last year. Total year-to-date coal imports into China are roughly 9% higher than last year, a level of growth the investment bank calls "weak" and "contracting." The government has been trying to phase out coal heating in favor of gas heating, but Barclays warned a gas shortage could hit this winter. If it materializes, "coal could be the beneficiary, picking up market share and possibly driving import levels higher over the winter." (lynn.cook@wsj.com; @LynnJCook)
