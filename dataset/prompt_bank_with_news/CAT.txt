1206 ET - The planned elevation of CFO Ted Christie to CEO of discount carrier Spirit Airlines at the dawn of 2019 hews to the timing of current CEO Bob Fornaro 's employment agreement. When Fornaro, age 64, a Spirit director, was tapped to be CEO in January 2016, he signed a three-year contract. The idea was it would be enough time for the airline veteran to turn around Spirit, which had grown too fast and become unreliable for customers. Fornaro has succeeded in improving operational metrics and tamped down growth, but Spirit shares remain down 24% YTD. Christie, age 47, joined the company in 2012 as CFO after holding that position at two other carriers. He will become Spirit's president and a director on Jan. 1, and take the top job a year later.

1151 ET - Inventories of crude oil at a tank farm in Cushing, Okla. are falling sharply into the end of the year, an uncommon occurrence that may reflect a booming US oil-export business. For years, analysts noted oil storage in Cushing would rise late in the year while storage in the Gulf region simultaneously fell, as companies wanted to avoid high, end-of-year Texas tax assessments on stored oil. Last year, for example, Gulf oil storage fell by 10M bbls November thru December while Cushing rose 10M. But this year, Cushing storage is down by 13M bbls since early November, while the Gulf, where companies increasingly need to keep high inventories for export purposes, is relatively flat.

1128 ET - A long-running controversy over chicken pricing hatches another lawsuit, as a group of grocery store operators and distributors sue the biggest US chicken processors over alleged collusion. The plaintiffs, which run and service more than 1,700 grocery stores across the country, filed a lawsuit in federal court in Illinois seeking damages related to poultry meat purchases from 2008 through 2016, during which time they say chicken companies surreptitiously reduced production and manipulated a pricing index maintained by Georgia's Agriculture Department, inflating prices for shrink-wrapped chicken breasts and wings. A Tyson spokesman calls the claims "unfounded because we've not done anything wrong." A Perdue Farms spokeswoman declines to comment; officials with Pilgrim's Pride and Sanderson Farms don't respond to requests for comment. (jacob.bunge@wsj.com; @jacobbunge)

1057 ET - Oil prices decline after a mixed EIA inventory report and as investors start to look ahead to an expected Fed rate hike today that could boost the dollar and hurt oil which is priced in greenbacks.

1050 ET - Is the recent stunning rise in the price of bitcoin for real? The overwhelming majority of economists say it's in fact being driven by speculation. In a WSJ survey conducted Dec 8-11, some 96% of academic, business and financial economists said bitcoin has been experiencing a speculative bubble, with some making explicit comparisons to the famous Dutch tulipmania of the 17th century. "If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it's a duck," says Diane Swonk of DS Economics. (ben.leubsdorf@wsj.com; @BenLeubsdorf)

1047 ET - Amazon partners with Samsung on HDR10+, offering its Prime Video catalog in the new format. Amazon says it's the first streaming service provider to do so, and it's available on Samsung 's 2017 UHD TV lineup. Adding new formats for streaming may give consumers another reason to pull the trigger on Prime membership, which includes Amazon 's video streaming service. Those customers tend to spend more than twice their non-member counterparts with Amazon , according to analyst estimates. (laura.stevens@wsj.com; @laurastevenswsj)

1041 ET - Honeywell had a slow year for deals but expects $14B in usable cash for 2018 and "M&A remains a top priority." On Wednesday, Honeywell detailed its recent investment in Flux, a Chinese supply chain software company for e-commerce and sees opportunities for similar deals. CFO Tom Szlosek said the "the pipeline across all of the businesses is quite active." While tax changes could encourage US deals, he noted that Honeywell hasn't had any issues with access to capital. In terms of big moves--like merging with United Technologies --Szlosek described the exploration of such a deal last year as "once in a lifetime" and "not something that we are trying to reinvigorate." Honeywell would be "sticking to our knitting." (thomas.gryta@wsj.com @tgryta)
