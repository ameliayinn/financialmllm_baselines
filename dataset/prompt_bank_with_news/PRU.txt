Prudential's profit increased almost 5% to $1.49 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $1.42 billion the same quarter last year, the company reported Tuesday evening.

"During the third quarter, we continued to execute on our 2020 priorities. We continued to reprice products and pivot to less rate-sensitive products," said Charles Lowrey, Prudential chairman and chief executive. "We also took further measures to rotate our earnings mix toward higher growth markets."

Prudential, one of the largest U.S. insurers, kicked off insurance earnings this week. The company is often seen as the bellwether for the quarter's insurance-industry performance.

Assets under management for the Newark, N.J., company increased 8.5% to $1.65 trillion, with assets under management the company's global investment management arm at a record high.

For insurers like Prudential, profit comes from investing client's premiums until claims are due. These investments are largely in the form of premium bonds. Lower interest rates mean lower returns on these investments.

Because the Federal Reserve has said interest rates will remain low for years to come, Prudential and other insurers have re-evaluated their products, raising prices on some, eliminating others.

Prudential has also put a focus on cutting costs. The firm said that it has already cut $135 million this year out of its $140 million goal -- and plans to slash an additional $250 million by the end of 2023 for a total of $750 million in cuts.

"We are continuing to improve how we help our customers, and our employees are creating new ways of working," said Mr. Lowrey.

Prudential reported its earnings after market on Tuesday, but ended the day with shares up 2.8%.
