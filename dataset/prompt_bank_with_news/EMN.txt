leverage solid underlying business conditions for growth. Our 
specialties continued their strong performance, marked by exceptional 
growth in Additives & Functional Products," said Mark Costa , Board Chair

With both of these challenges, our ability to minimize disruption and 
reduce impact is a testament to our scale, vertical integration, and the 
tremendous capability and determination of the Eastman team."

items in 3Q 2017 and 2016, and reconciliation to reported company and 
segment earnings, see Tables 3A and 4A. 
 
   Segment Results 3Q 2017 versus 3Q 2016 
 
   Additives & Functional Products - Sales revenue increased primarily due 
to higher sales volume for most product lines. Operating earnings 
increased primarily due to higher sales volume. 
 
   Advanced Materials - Sales revenue increased due to improved product mix 
from higher sales volume of premium products. Operating earnings were 
unchanged compared to record earnings in the year ago period. 
 
   Chemical Intermediates - Sales revenue increased due to higher selling 
prices attributed to higher raw material prices and continued 
improvement in competitive conditions. Operating earnings increased 
primarily due to higher selling prices, lower commodity hedge levels, 
and lower operating costs, partially offset by higher raw material and 
energy costs. 
 
   Fibers - Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices, 
particularly for acetate tow, attributed to lower industry capacity 
utilization rates. Operating earnings declined due to lower selling 
prices, partially offset by lower operating costs resulting from recent 
actions. 
 
   Cash Flow 
 
   Eastman generated $528 million in cash from operating activities during 
third quarter 2017 primarily due to strong net earnings. Total 
borrowings decreased $187 million and share repurchases totaled $100 
million during the quarter. 
 
   In first nine months 2017, the company generated cash from operations of 
over $1 billion and $573 million of free cash flow (defined as cash from 
operating activities minus capital expenditures). In addition, the 
company returned $498 million to stockholders with $275 million of share 
repurchases and $223 million of dividends. The company continues to 
expect to generate approximately $1 billion of free cash flow in 2017. 
 
   See Tables 5A, 5B and 6A. Priorities for uses of available cash include 
payment of the quarterly dividend, repayment of debt, funding targeted 
growth initiatives, and repurchasing shares. 
 
   Kingsport Coal Gasification Operational Incident 
 
   As previously announced, on October 4, 2017 an explosion in the 
Kingsport site's coal gasification area disrupted manufacturing 
operations. There were no serious injuries and no impact to the 
environment. All manufacturing operations have resumed except for coal 
gasification. Due to the unique advantages of our scale and integration, 
the company has made excellent progress in repairing the facility and 
implemented alternate processes to maintain operations of downstream 
derivative facilities of coal gasification. We expect the coal 
gasification area to be operable by the end of fourth quarter 2017. This, 
along with our mitigating actions, is expected to enable full production 
of acetyl chemicals and derivatives. Normal operations are expected to 
resume in early 2018. 
 
   While the company continues to assess the financial impact of the 
incident, the net impact is expected to reduce operating earnings by 
between $50 and $100 million. Costs in fourth quarter 2017 related to 
the incident are expected to be approximately $100 million, partially 
offset by insurance recovery expected in first half 2018. 
 
   Outlook 
 
 
 
   Commenting on the outlook for full-year 2017, Costa said: "Our excellent 
third-quarter results build on the strong performance we have delivered 
throughout the year.  We continue to create our own growth with 
innovative, high margin products in what remains an uncertain global 
business environment. Capital allocation and cost management are also 
contributing to earnings growth. As a result, our expectations for 
adjusted 2017 EPS growth have improved to be solidly at the high end of 
the previously projected range of 10 to 12 percent compared with 2016, 
excluding the financial impact of the Kingsport operational incident." 
 
   The full-year 2017 projected earnings exclude any non-core, unusual, or 
non-recurring items in fourth quarter 2017, assumes that the adjusted 
tax rate detailed in Tables 4A and 4B for first nine months 2017 will be 
the actual rate for full-year 2017, and excludes the financial impact of 
the Kingsport operational incident. Our 2017 financial results forecasts 
do not include non-core items (such as mark-to-market pension and other 
postretirement benefit gain or loss) or any unusual or non-recurring 
items, and we accordingly are unable to reconcile projected full-year 
2017 earnings excluding non-core and any unusual or non-recurring items 
to reported GAAP earnings without unreasonable efforts. 
 
   Forward-Looking Statements 
 
   This news release includes forward-looking statements concerning current 
expectations and assumptions for future global economic conditions; 
competitive position and acceptance of specialty products in key 
markets; mix of products sold; raw material and energy prices and costs, 
and other costs; and revenue, earnings, and cash flow for full-year 
2017. Such expectations and assumptions are based upon certain 
preliminary information, internal estimates, and management assumptions, 
expectations, and plans, and are subject to a number of risks and 
uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions, events, and 
results. Actual results could differ materially from expectations and 
assumptions expressed in the forward-looking statements if one or more 
of the underlying assumptions or expectations prove to be inaccurate or 
are unrealized. Important factors that could cause actual results to 
differ materially from such expectations are and will be detailed in the 
company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission , including 
the Form 10-Q filed for second quarter 2017 available, and the Form 10-Q 
to be filed for third quarter 2017 and to be available, on the Eastman

   Segment Results 3Q 2017 versus 3Q 2016 
 
   Additives & Functional Products - Sales revenue increased primarily due 
to higher sales volume for most product lines. Operating earnings 
increased primarily due to higher sales volume. 
 
   Advanced Materials - Sales revenue increased due to improved product mix 
from higher sales volume of premium products. Operating earnings were

   Cash Flow 
 
   Eastman generated $528 million in cash from operating activities during 
third quarter 2017 primarily due to strong net earnings. Total 
borrowings decreased $187 million and share repurchases totaled $100 
million during the quarter. 
 
   In first nine months 2017, the company generated cash from operations of 
over $1 billion and $573 million of free cash flow (defined as cash from 
operating activities minus capital expenditures). In addition, the 
company returned $498 million to stockholders with $275 million of share 
repurchases and $223 million of dividends. The company continues to 
expect to generate approximately $1 billion of free cash flow in 2017. 
 
   See Tables 5A, 5B and 6A. Priorities for uses of available cash include 
payment of the quarterly dividend, repayment of debt, funding targeted 
growth initiatives, and repurchasing shares. 
 
   Kingsport Coal Gasification Operational Incident 
 
   As previously announced, on October 4, 2017 an explosion in the 
Kingsport site's coal gasification area disrupted manufacturing 
operations. There were no serious injuries and no impact to the 
environment. All manufacturing operations have resumed except for coal 
gasification. Due to the unique advantages of our scale and integration, 
the company has made excellent progress in repairing the facility and 
implemented alternate processes to maintain operations of downstream 
derivative facilities of coal gasification. We expect the coal 
gasification area to be operable by the end of fourth quarter 2017. This, 
along with our mitigating actions, is expected to enable full production 
of acetyl chemicals and derivatives. Normal operations are expected to 
resume in early 2018. 
 
   While the company continues to assess the financial impact of the 
incident, the net impact is expected to reduce operating earnings by 
between $50 and $100 million. Costs in fourth quarter 2017 related to 
the incident are expected to be approximately $100 million, partially 
offset by insurance recovery expected in first half 2018. 
 
   Outlook 
 
 
 
   Commenting on the outlook for full-year 2017, Costa said: "Our excellent 
third-quarter results build on the strong performance we have delivered 
throughout the year.  We continue to create our own growth with 
innovative, high margin products in what remains an uncertain global 
business environment. Capital allocation and cost management are also 
contributing to earnings growth. As a result, our expectations for 
adjusted 2017 EPS growth have improved to be solidly at the high end of 
the previously projected range of 10 to 12 percent compared with 2016, 
excluding the financial impact of the Kingsport operational incident." 
 
   The full-year 2017 projected earnings exclude any non-core, unusual, or 
non-recurring items in fourth quarter 2017, assumes that the adjusted 
tax rate detailed in Tables 4A and 4B for first nine months 2017 will be 
the actual rate for full-year 2017, and excludes the financial impact of 
the Kingsport operational incident. Our 2017 financial results forecasts 
do not include non-core items (such as mark-to-market pension and other 
postretirement benefit gain or loss) or any unusual or non-recurring 
items, and we accordingly are unable to reconcile projected full-year 
2017 earnings excluding non-core and any unusual or non-recurring items 
to reported GAAP earnings without unreasonable efforts. 
 
   Forward-Looking Statements 
 
   This news release includes forward-looking statements concerning current 
expectations and assumptions for future global economic conditions; 
competitive position and acceptance of specialty products in key 
markets; mix of products sold; raw material and energy prices and costs,

2017. Such expectations and assumptions are based upon certain 
preliminary information, internal estimates, and management assumptions, 
expectations, and plans, and are subject to a number of risks and
