BlackRock called it a landmark transaction and "among the largest custody deals ever signed."

J.P. Morgan's custody services include settling and holding onto clients' securities for safety purposes. It also provides accounting services and administration for funds.

The bank plans to bring those assets onboard its $20.5 trillion platform over the next two years. Citing "a person familiar with the matter," The Wall Street Journal says the deal may lift J.P. Morgan to the No. 2 position in the business behind Bank of New York Mellon ( BK).

What does all this mean for J.P. Morgan and State Street?

As The WSJ reports:

State Street's assets under custody were $21.7 trillion as of Wednesday when it reported fourth-quarter earnings, though it is unclear if the change was reflected in the most recent quarterly numbers. State Street noted in an earnings slide presentation Wednesday that BlackRock had moved some of its assets "as a result of a decision to diversify service providers," but remains a client of the bank.

J.P. Morgan is likely to garner roughly tens of millions of dollars in annual fees in one of the largest-ever custody deals. The sticky business is becoming rare in banking where firms have been cutting costs to boost revenues in a low-interest-rate environment. These types of contracts usually don't come up for bid for years.

State Street's share price fell 4.3% to $77.05 in recent market action, while J.P. Morgan's stock price rose 1.4% to $85.91 a share.
