1557 ET - Lockheed Martin CFO Bruce Tanner says margins on the F-35 program are set to top 10% next year, a milestone that brings profits from the stealthy jet closer to those of legacy planes such as the F-16. That's even with the Pentagon taking more control of the stealthy jet's cost-cutting initiative. Lockheed is down 2.3% at $313.34 after missing earnings expectations for the second time in three quarters, plus a 2018 guide which some analysts viewed as light, though the company's first peek at next year is usually conservative.

1551 ET - 3M 's electronics and energy business had been a quarterly whipping boy for analysts disappointed with its performance. But the unit turned in a particularly strong 3Q with sales rising 13% and operating income soaring by one-third from last year. 3M hasn't thrown in the towel on the hyper-competitive and volatile consumer electronics market, but it's migrated to some smaller markets with faster-growing sales, including electric automobiles. "Those are places where we're seeing the results of our actions paying off," CFO Nicholas Gangestad , tells analysts today. "What you're seeing now is our business model really working." 3M up 6.5% at $235.86. (robert.tita@wsj.com; @bob_tita)

1536 ET - [Dow Jones ] The NZD/AUD will be all about the Australian CPI data today, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group says. The market is anticipating a lift in headline and core measures to 2%. This should provide support for the Aussie, "but our Australian colleagues are expecting a slightly lower core outcome, which wouldn't be the smoking gun for the RBA," ANZ says. The cross was at 0.8865 early in Asia on Wednesday, with resistance seen at 0.8980 and support at 0.8820. (ben.collins@wsj.com)

1529 ET - Auto makers, suppliers and dealers forge group to lobby against withdrawal from North American Free Trade Agreement , arguing pact has created jobs and Trump administration shouldn't "change the game in the middle of a comeback." Groups representing likes of GM , Ford , Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai join dealers and suppliers in coalition dubbed "Driving American Jobs." Effort comes amid NAFTA negotiations between U.S., Mexico and Canada, and president's criticism of auto makers for building outside American borders. President Donald Trump has threatened to quit the deal. Trump administration had proposed changing NAFTA 's rules of origin so 85% of content in cars be North American parts, and 50% hail from US, the latter a first. Auto makers have pushed back on that proposal. (mike.spector@wsj.com; @MikeSpectorWSJ)

1528 ET - Despite President Maduro's low popularity and Venezuela's crippling economic crisis, it's the leader's detractors who appear to be more fractured than ever as they reel from their loss in recent state governor elections. The opposition's most prominent leader, Henrique Capriles , says he will no longer be a part of the opposition coalition until the Democratic Action Party, one of the alliance's biggest members, pulls out. Democratic Action is under fire and faces accusations of kowtowing to the authoritarian government after four of their governors on Monday agreed to take oath of office by submitting their authority to the pro-Maduro legislative superbody. Democratic Action chief Henry Ramos says his party has betrayed no one, but Capriles is adamant that there is no way forward together. "What happened yesterday has no justification," Capriles says.

1523 ET - [Dow Jones ] The Kiwi's woes continued overnight with government policy direction uncertain and dairy prices easing further. A continuation of this trend is expected with the NZD now eyeing up support levels against most peers and the key support level of 0.6860 for NZD/USD, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group says. "Not all is lost though, with the lower NZD easing financial conditions, especially for exporters with the rosy global backdrop," the bank says. (ben.collins@wsj.com)

1436 ET - AbbVie is betting big on a new approach to combating Alzheimer's disease from biotechnology company Alector. AbbVie is paying $205M up front to the startup through a collaboration to develop treatments for the neurological disease, which affects 5.5 million Americans. Alzheimer's has been a graveyard for drugmakers. Last month Axovant Sciences saw a therapy that promotes release of the brain chemical acetylcholine fail in late-stage clinical trials. Instead of targeting specific disease mechanisms, Alector develops drugs that awaken the immune system in the brain so it can carry out functions that stop the progression of Alzheimer's. AbbVie is also developing a different type of Alzheimer's drug that targets the protein tau. (brian.gormley@wsj.com)

1419 ET - The SEC will intervene to protect US brokers from the biggest consequences of a European law that overhauls how investors pay for Wall Street research. The SEC's chairman, Jay Clayton , tells an industry conference that the SEC's relief should be "satisfactory" to Wall Street. Under the European law, known as Mifid II [Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II], investors are required to pay separately for research rather than funding it through trade commissions. Without SEC intervention, US broker-dealers could face stricter regulation of analyst research when they sell it separately to European funds, because the reports could be deemed to be investment advice. The SEC is working with European regulators to craft the relief so it doesn't impede Europe's goals for more transparency but also protects the way business is done in the US, Clayton says.
