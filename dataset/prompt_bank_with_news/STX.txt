10:41 ET - Lexicon Pharmaceuticals (LXRX) jumps 22% after the release of positive data from a late-stage drug trial. Lexicon and partner Sanofi are developing a diabetes pill, dubbed sotagliflozin, that the partners portray as the next generation of SGLT inhibitors. Such drugs, like AstraZeneca's (AZN) Farxiga, J&J's (JNJ) Inovkana, and Lilly (LLY) and Boehringer's Jardiance, are approved to treat type 2 diabetics though some doctors give them for type 1 of the disease. In the 793-subject trial, sotagliflozin met its primary endpoint of reducing blood sugar levels in type 1 patients by statistically significant amounts over 24 weeks, Lexicon said. Other phase 3 trials in type 1 patients are ongoing. Sanofi is expected to begin phase 3 trials for the drug in type 2 patients by the end of this year. (jonathan.rockoff@wsj.com; @jonathanrockoff)

10:35 ET - Kroger (KR) cuts yearly guidance, but was it enough given the punishing deflationary cycle in food prices supermarkets have faced? BMO says KR's cut "may not be as bad as feared," however, "given our expectation for deflation to accelerate in the Fall and linger ... 'is it conservative enough given low visibility?'" Guggenheim thinks the "2H guide could have been a lot worse," adding "challenges associated with food deflation are the worst-kept secret in retail, especially after Sprouts Farmers Markets (SFM) and Supervalu (SVU) guidedowns in the past few days." Guggenheim doesn't expect deflation to persist through 2017 and thinks KR's investments in the business should continue "to drive profitable share gains." It recommends buying in the low 30s. KR up 3c to $31.34. (patrick.sheridan@wsj.com)

10:27 ET - A judge said two JBS (JBSS3.BR) controlling shareholders have asked him to change a court order suspending them from their company Monday, as an investigation into alleged fraud at some of Brazil's largest pension funds approaches. Judge Vallisney de Souza Oliveira told WSJ late Thursday that lawyers representing brothers Wesley Batista, the CEO of the world's largest meatpacker, and Chairman Joesley Batista, who have been suspended from managing or working at any company, have asked that the order be restricted only to their paper and pulp producer Eldorado Brasil, which is the target of the investigation. There is no indication that JBS is involved in the alleged fraud, but the holding company that controls the meat processor also controls Eldorado. JBS shares fall 2.2%. (luciana.magalhaes@wsj.com)

10:18 ET - Toys will still be under the Christmas Tree this year, BMO says, as it downplays concerns over the bankruptcy filing of the Korean shipping company Hanjin Shipping. The firm says that major toy companies like Hasbro (HAS) and Mattel (MAT) say they have little to no exposure to Hanjin and diversified away from the shipping company earlier this year. 2016 shipping rates are already locked in, so the sharp spikes in prices won't hurt results this year, but could send rates higher for next year. There is more concern that goods are delayed somewhat, which have a domino effect of fewer reorders, but toy makers "feel the overall impact would be minimal. (paul.ziobro@wsj.com; @pziobro)

10:00 ET - Capital Economics, a perennial Canada bear, says details of Canada's August jobs report were underwhelming and illustrate why Bank of Canada adopted dovish tone in its Sept 7 rate decision. It noted for the 12-month period ended Aug 31, Canadian employment rose a paltry 0.1%, or 77K, with all the job gains part-time. August job increases were concentrated among Canada's youth and those 55 and over. As for Canadians in prime-working years, 25 to 54, employment fell 25K, or broadly unchanged for this category in past 12 months. Annual wage gains slowed to a new 2-year low. "Slack in the labor market is increasing rather than shrinking," firm added. (paul.vieira@wsj.com; @paulvieira)

9:36 ET - In an otherwise brutal stretch for for-profit colleges, Bridgepoint Education's (BPI) Ashford won some reprieve, as Iowa's Department of Education said it would allow the school more time to resolve a challenge regarding GI Bill benefits. Iowa had said in May that Ashford would need to get approval to give GI benefits through California's authorizing agency, putting the funding for more than 6,000 military students in question. Now, according to according to Inside Higher Education, funding will continue at least until the court case is resolved. BPI slips 0.8% to $7.26. (melissa.korn@wsj.com; @melissakorn)

9:27 ET - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has proposed imposing fines on--or requiring increased rebates from--drug companies that excessively raise prices on older products. In light of this, Leerink Partners analyzed pricing history for nearly 1,000 pharmaceutical brands dating to 2011 and found that the median compound annual growth rate for was 10%. Among companies that raised list prices more frequently and aggressively, according to Leerink, were: Valeant (VRX), Horizon Pharma (HZNP), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Pfizer (PFE) and Biogen (BIIB). Many of the products had annual sales of less than $200M, and Leerink says, "It would appear companies have opportunistically employed more aggressive price tactics on these smaller 'under-the-radar' products."

9:01 ET - The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has broken through a psychological barrier, pushing above 1.635% for the first time since June 23, the day of the Brexit vote, according to Tradeweb. Selling started Thursday when the European Central Bank disappointed some investors by not announcing more stimulus, sparking discussion of whether central banks are reaching the limits of their easing policies. Those concerns are mixing with resurgent speculation that the Fed could raise rates in September and preparations for auctions of three-year and 10-year Treasurys on Monday. The 10-year yield was recently 1.651% vs. 1.614% Thursday. (sam.goldfarb@wsj.com)

8:58 ET - Initial reaction from economists to Canada's August jobs? A shoulder shrug. "This is not really a lot to get excited about truth to be told," said David Tulk, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities. He said additional data indicates hours worked declined 0.3% in month, even though full-time employment rose for first time in three months. Wage growth was a tepid 1.5%. He added the longer term trend also shows weakness in Canadian employment. The 3-month moving average indicates Canada shed roughly 2K per month, whereas on 6-month basis country added average 8K a month. On its own, Canadian employment data "is consistent with an economy that remains soft," Tulk added. (paul.vieira@wsj.com; @paulvieira)
