We are lowering our estimated second-quarter earnings per share for Chipotle Mexican Grill to $2.00 (from $2.33), putting us below consensus of $2.43. Our 2017/2018 EPS estimate moves to $6.98/$10.77, respectively (from $7.31/$11.16), below consensus $8.46/$12.19, respectively.

Following meetings with investors Monday, Chipotle (ticker: CMG) issued a press release after the close to "reaffirm and clarify" several guidance items. Fiscal 2017 guidance on same-store sales (SSS) and unit growth reiterated, but updated guidance on second-quarter food costs and other operating expenses was unfavorable to our model and consensus (per Consensus Metrix). No update on second-quarter-to-date SSS trends. Bottom line, this update should lead to modest downward earnings revisions.

[We rate Chipotle at Neutral and maintain a $425 price target.]

Management guided to second-quarter cost-of-goods-sold (COGS) margin of about 34.2%, about 100 basis points above our prior model and about 40 basis points above consensus. Guidance on the second quarter other operating expenses as percentage of sales guided to "at or slightly higher than reported for the first quarter." This implies other operating-expense margin of about 14.1%-14.2%, about 50 basis points above our prior model and consensus. We have brought our model in line with guidance on these two items. Management reiterated fiscal 2017 SSS guidance of "high single digits," 195-210 net new openings, and a 39% tax rate, each of which is in line with our model and consensus.

Note: we have made no changes to our SSS or unit growth forecasts.
