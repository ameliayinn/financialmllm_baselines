Innovation and Financial Strength scores in Top 2.5% of all NYSE and NASDAQ Listed Companies 


CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 06, 2017-- 

In the inaugural ranking of the Most Effectively Managed Companies released by the Drucker Institute, The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) was ranked sixth among hundreds of Fortune 500, S&P 500 and other large-cap companies evaluated on overall corporate effectiveness. Other top ranked companies include Amazon.com Inc ., Apple Inc ., Alphabet Inc ., Johnson & Johnson , IBM and Microsoft, Inc .

P&G earned recognition in the premier ranking based on exemplary scores in 37 indicators categorizing performance in Customer Satisfaction, Employee Engagement and Development, Innovation, Social Responsibility and Financial Strength. Underlying these areas are fifteen business principles developed by professor, management consultant and author, the late Peter Drucker, that specify what drives corporate "effectiveness," which he defined as "doing the right things well."

"Our ranking offers a breakthrough view of corporate effectiveness by integrating performance across areas too often viewed in isolation," said Zachary First, Executive Director of the Drucker Institute. "P&G is one of only six companies this year that excels at the whole picture, with all five component scores at least one standard deviation above the mean. They are in an elite group that is well positioned for long-term, sustained success."

When establishing criteria, The Drucker Institute's primary objective was to create a method of evaluation that provides executives and investors with a line of sight into the holistic, longer-term perspective for a company.

"We are honored by this recognition which supports our view of what's working well at P&G ," said David Taylor , P&G 's Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Every day P&G people work to serve consumers with superior brands and reward shareholders with balanced, sustainable long-term growth and value creation. This recognition is further validation that we are on the right track."

P&G secured an especially strong score in Financial Strength, a category reflecting factors such as market share, total shareholder return and earnings for common shareholders, among others. Of nearly 700 companies included in the ranking, P&G led every company for aggregate market share, inclusive of the number of categories and margin of leadership.

Innovation is at the heart of P&G , another area reflected by an especially strong score in the rankings. P&G is constantly working to delight consumers and continue to grow product categories that meet consumer needs through deep consumer understanding and superior technology development.

P&G 's unwavering focus on longevity has generated business success and earned external recognition across numerous performance benchmarking categories. P&G is widely known for Customer Satisfaction and Social Responsibility, stemming from attentiveness to market trends and commitment to sustainability and citizenship efforts. Another element of the ranking, Employee Engagement and Development is crucial to the Company's success -- cultivating and rewarding talent through a strong, inclusive, merit-based culture that drives success both from within the company and the broader marketplace.

The late Peter Drucker is widely recognized by the global business community. He authored 39 major books, was celebrated by BusinessWeek as "the man who invented management" and was featured on the cover of Forbes as "Still the Youngest Mind," among numerous other accolades.
