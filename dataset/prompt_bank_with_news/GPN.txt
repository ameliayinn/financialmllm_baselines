This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200803005127/en/ 

"We are pleased with our performance in the second quarter, with each month exceeding our post COVID-19 expectations and results improving significantly in May and June. We are also very proud of our team members around the globe for their exceptional and continuous dedication to our customers and the communities in which they live and work despite difficult circumstances," said Jeff Sloan , Chief Executive Officer.

"We continue to make substantial progress on our strategic goals. First, we entered into a new relationship with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to be our preferred cloud provider for our issuer business. We expect our collaboration with AWS to drive innovative payments solutions worldwide; substantially expand our target addressable opportunities; enable best-in-class experiences for our customers and their consumers; and facilitate revenue possibilities with Amazon across all segments of our business. Together with AWS, we will deliver an industry-leading, cloud-based platform to institutions worldwide, bringing transformative technologies to all types of issuers and providing consumers with frictionless digital experiences."

Sloan added, "Second, we are delighted to expand our relationship with longstanding partner CaixaBank by agreeing to meaningfully increase our ownership in our joint venture and extending our partnership through 2040. CaixaBank is one of the largest banks in Europe and is Spain's leading financial group. Their confidence in us further highlights the strength of our differentiated model as the partner of choice to the most sophisticated and complex institutions globally."

Second Quarter 2020 Summary 


   -- GAAP revenues were $1.672 billion, compared to $935 million in the second 
      quarter of 2019; diluted earnings per share were $0.12 compared to $0.77 
      in the prior year; and operating margin was 6.4%. 
 
   -- Adjusted net revenues declined 14% to $1.521 billion, compared to $1.772 
      billion in the second quarter of 2019 on a combined basis. 
 
   -- Adjusted earnings per share declined 13% to $1.31, compared to $1.51 in 
      the second quarter of 2019. 
 
   -- Adjusted operating margin was 37.0%, compared to 37.4% in the second 
      quarter of 2019 on a combined basis. 

Financial Highlights

"We delivered solid financial performance for the second quarter in a challenging environment and are encouraged by the recovery across our businesses, which has continued in July," said Paul Todd , Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "Our cost actions in response to the pandemic remain on track to deliver $400 million in additional annual run rate expense savings, which is incremental to the at least $350 million of annual run rate expense synergies and at least $125 million in annual run rate revenue synergies we expect to achieve through 2022 related to the TSYS merger."

Todd concluded, "We benefited by entering the crisis in extraordinary condition, and the timing and quantum of our actions taken early on enabled us to substantially exceed our adjusted operating margin expectations for the quarter. Finally, our strong cash flows, together with our investment grade balance sheet and liquidity position, provide us with significant financial flexibility to continue to pursue strategic priorities opportunistically as markets stabilize."

Capital Allocation

Global Payments ' Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.195 per share payable September 24, 2020 to shareholders of record as of September 10, 2020.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Global Payments supplements revenues, income, operating income, operating margin and EPS information determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP by providing these measures, and other measures, with certain adjustments (such measures being non-GAAP financial measures) in this document to assist with evaluating our performance. In addition to GAAP measures, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to focus on the factors the company believes are pertinent to the daily management of our operations. Management believes adjusted net revenue more closely reflects the economic benefits to the company's core business and allows for better comparisons with industry peers. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, together with other metrics, to set goals for and measure the performance of the business and to determine incentive compensation. Adjusted net revenue, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS should be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, revenues, operating income, net income and EPS determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures reflect management's judgment of particular items, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Adjusted net revenue excludes gross-up related payments associated with certain lines of business to reflect economic benefits to the company. On a GAAP basis, these payments are presented gross in both revenues and operating expenses. Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS exclude acquisition-related amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, acquisition and integration expense and certain other items, such as unusual, direct and discrete costs due to the global pandemic, specific to each reporting period as more fully described in the accompanying reconciliations in Schedules 6 and 7. Adjusted operating margin is derived by dividing adjusted operating income by adjusted net revenue. The tax rate used in determining the income tax impact of earnings adjustments is either the jurisdictional statutory rate in effect at the time of the adjustment or the jurisdictional expected annual effective tax rate for the period, depending on the nature and timing of the adjustment.
