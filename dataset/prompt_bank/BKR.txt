1204 ET - Efforts at oil majors like BP to shift their businesses toward green energy sources have attracted a lot of attention, but smaller companies involved in fossil fuels are also trying to showcase their environmental work. Earlier Tuesday, Baker Hughes said it would acquire a company that can capture carbon emissions, which cause climate change. On an investor call, executives at natural-gas pipeline operator Williams said the company has established a team to explore opportunities tied to adding more solar-energy systems across its operation, in hydrogen energy and carbon-capture technologies, among other efforts. Oil, gas and coal companies face heightened pressure from some investors to demonstrate how they will push against climate change and may deal with new regulatory requirements, depending on today's election.

1204 ET - The election outcome that matters for hospitality businesses such as restaurants and hotels, which have been battered by the Covid-19 pandemic, isn't so much about who gets to sit in the Oval Office, says Luke Pototschnik, a consumer-goods consultant at Boston Consulting. It's control of Congress that matters, he says, as the body would ultimately decide how much the businesses get in stimulus and how they operate during the pandemic. "It's probably going to be less about the person and more about the policy," Pototschnik says. The market lately has been buoyed partly by bets that Democrats will take control of both the White House and Congress. That outcome would make it more likely lawmakers will approve a generous stimulus package to spur economic activity. (dave.sebastian@wsj.com; @depsebastian)

1156 ET - A Democratic sweep of Tuesday's election could help boost electric-vehicle adoption in the US, which has lagged compared with China and Europe, according to Baird. With control of Congress and the White House, Democrats could restore the full tax credit for electric vehicles, and work with state and local governments to deploy public electric-vehicle infrastructure. Under a Biden presidency with a divided Congress, executive action on fuel-economy standards or trade with China could be the biggest influence on electric vehicles. Overall, a Biden win would be a net positive for the space, according to Baird. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)

1121 ET - Investment bank UBS says that regardless of who wins the election today--their firm expects a Democratic sweep--the economy will continue to mend. "The pace will be affected by the timing and magnitude of additional fiscal stimulus, and that hinges on the election outcome," writes Jason Draho , leader of asset allocation for UBS Global Wealth Management. "But the bounce-back in manufacturing, the strength of consumer spending, and Federal Reserve accommodation all support a continual recovery," he said. (michael.derby@wsj.com)

1119 ET - Spirit AeroSystems follows Boeing in expecting cash breakeven to be a 2022 event, even if the plane maker hasn't completely abandoned the goal of eliminating the burn by the end of next year. Spirit CEO Tom Gentile says on an investor call that it will follow Boeing 's 737 MAX production plan, which currently envisages monthly assembly of 31 a month in late 2021, and work down a buffer of around 100 aircraft shipsets--fuselages and other parts. Still, Boeing is expected to account for less than half of Spirit 's revenue next year, a first. Spirit is up 1%. (doug.cameron@wsj.com; @dougcameron)

1118 ET - Sysco is focusing on winning new customers during the pandemic so that the foodservice distributor can emerge stronger post-Covid, executives say during the quarterly earnings call. The company has updated its sales compensation model that aims to incentivize staff to sign up more operators. Sysco is gaining share among local operators and sees opportunities to serve more independent businesses, they add. Shares up 4.6%. (jaewon.kang@wsj.com; @_jaewonkang)

1112 ET - Restaurant operators in Southern states and rural geographies are performing better than the national average, Sysco executives say during a quarterly earnings call. States that consist of urban cities, such as California, are struggling and that performance is directly tied to restrictions, they added. In Europe, where restrictions have become tighter in recent days, the foodservice distributor is anticipating sales to soften this month. (jaewon.kang@wsj.com; @_jaewonkang)

1109 ET - The U.S. presidential election outcome could be clear relatively quickly, but it depends on results in key states and how long they take to emerge, says Goldman Sachs . Former Vice President Joe Biden leads polls narrowly in Arizona, Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, Goldman says. "Winning any of these would make it difficult for President Trump to reach 270 electoral votes. Since these states are likely to report results quickly, there is a good chance the presidential election outcome will be clear on election night," Goldman analysts say. "However, if President Trump wins these Sun Belt states, the contest will hinge on Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin; the first two are likely to take days to report results."

1104 ET - Executives at Agco , the tractor and combine maker, say farmers in the US and Canada have been cautious throughout the year, despite billions in fresh government aid. Now, stronger commodity pricing and payments are boosting confidence, one Agco leader says, flowing through to the company. "We're continuing to see strong order boards and we're working our inventory down," he adds. Net sales in North America are up 3% during the first nine months, excluding currency fluctuations, helped by demand for hay equipment and high-horsepower tractors, offset by lower grain and protein products as well as sprayer sales. Agco shares up 6.8%. (micah.maidenberg@wsj.com; @MicahMaidenberg)

1104 ET - Worries of a worsening European economy and weaker oil demand there due to renewed coronavirus lockdowns sent oil prices to a five-month-low last week, while signs of a strengthening US economy are helping crude prices rebound this week. WTI crude trades 3.3% higher today at $38.01/bbl after rising 2.8% Monday. One factor in the rebound, says Phil Flynn at Price Futures, is Monday's "sizzling U.S. manufacturing report that was the best in years, counteracting the doom and gloom over virus reports." Going forward, if Biden wins today's presidential election that might mean tighter coronavirus restrictions in the US, a move that could hurt oil demand short-term but perhaps help demand longer-term.
