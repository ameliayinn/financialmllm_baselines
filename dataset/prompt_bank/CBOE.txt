1519 ET - A trio of negative analyst notes triggered today's tech selloff. Analysts and investors pointed to notes from Goldman Sachs and UBS, which raised questions about the stock value of Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT). AAPL has been down as much as 5% today while FB, AMZN and MSFT are all down near 4%. Another negative was a report on Nvidia (NVDA) from Citron Research, which called the company a "casino stock" and said it should trade down to $130. NVDA is down 7%. Michael Frazier, CEO of Bedell Frazier Investment Counselling, which counts AAPL among its largest holdings, said tech stocks had hit a "euphoric state in recent weeks," and investors had been pulling back.

1511 ET - The S&P 500 IT Sector GICS Level 1 index is trading down 3.1%, something UBS analyst Julian Emanuel attributes to a natural market correction. The technology sector "had this very unusual confluence where technology in a lot of ways has almost become low beta, low volatility," trading at a lower volatility than traditional industries like utilities. "That to us is the kind of anomaly that isn't likely to be permanent," he says. Triggering the correction is likely the passage of political risk in Washington this week giving "investors a little bit of breathing space" and bringing reflation back into play. "That has fed into this rotation that we've seen. It's not just technology weakness, it's been pretty broad-based strength in financials and small gaps, which have lagged pretty badly." Energy stocks are another beneficiary. (laura.stevens@wsj.com; @laurastevenswsj)

1454 ET - The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, was edging toward its record low of 9.31 this morning, but has since rebounded. It's now up 15% since yesterday and is at 11.71, on track for its highest close since May 19. (gunjan.banerji@wsj.com; @gunjanjs)

1440 ET - A Brazilian electoral judge finishes an exposition he started Thursday morning showing how millions of Brazilian reais skimmed from state oil company Petrobras (PETR4.BR) were used to finance the winning Rousseff-Temer ticket in 2014 presidential election, an allegation both deny. The judge, Herman Benjamin, called for the election to be nullified and Temer, who replaced Rousseff last year after she was impeached, be overthrown. But at least four of the court's seven judges have signaled they aren't convinced, and pundits are expecting a final ruling later today keeping Temer in the presidency, which could breathe life into his economic-reform agenda.

1436 ET - Is the British Pound affecting tech stocks? That could be one factor in a selloff today, says Baird analyst Colin Sebastian, who notes that companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL) have exposure to the currency. "I don't think the UK pound movement helps," he adds. AMZN trades down 2.7% to $983. GOOGL is down 3% to $974.31. (laura.stevens@wsj.com; @laurastevenswsj)

1428 ET - If Americans want to work in a gig economy, "the government should not stand in their way," Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta says in a speech at New York University Law School. The US needs to update its workplace regulations while leaving "businesses and workers free to bargain for arrangements that best serve their needs," he says. Task-based, short-term gigs such as driving for Uber have raised concerns that gig workers are misclassified as independent contractors and that they have little or no access to benefits such as employer-subsidized retirement plans or health insurance. The previous Labor Dept tried to address some of those issues with guidance about joint employment and independent contracting; Acosta withdrew such guidance this week.

1305 ET - The USDA raises its projections for US stockpiles of cotton on ideas of higher global production that will cut into demand for US fiber in 2017/2018. Analysts surveyed by the WSJ had anticipated stockpiles in the US at 4.83M tons but the USDA says it expects 5.5M tons. Futures fell on the news with the July contract down 1.1% on the day.

1208 ET - Brazilian consumer prices behaved better than expected in May, and the continuing improvement in the country's inflation outlook could lead financial markets to expect bigger rate cuts from the central bank going forward, according to economists at Sao Paulo-based Haitong Banco de Investimento do Brasil SA. Brazil's 12-month inflation rate fell to 3.6% in May, the country's statistics agency said Friday. The rapid decline in the 12-month rate leaves the door open for the central bank to continue its cycle of interest rate cuts, and could lead some analysts to lower their forecast for the year-end level of the bank's benchmark Selic rate, Haitong said. The central bank cut the Selic by a full percentage point last week to 10.25%. (jeffrey.lewis@wsj.com)

1203 ET - A senior Vanguard Group strategy executive is retiring, shifting oversight responsibilities for the firm's strategic planning and governance matters to other firm leaders. Glenn Reed, who joined the company a decade ago to oversee its finance units, will retire in late July. WSJ reported early last year that Reed's financial responsibilities were moved to a newly-hired executive. Now, Chris McIsaac, managing director of Vanguard's planning and development division, will take on Reed's strategy work and Anne Robinson, managing director, legal and compliance, will oversee the firm's investment stewardship group. Reed, 64, was an outside counsel to the fast-growing $4.3T money manager for 20 years before he was hired in 2007. He is a member of the firm's 12-person management team; a spokeswoman said after his departure that group will consist of 11 members. (sarah.krouse@wsj.com; @bysarahkrouse)

1151 ET - Nordic markets close higher with Sweden's OMXS30 index ending the day 0.7% higher and the pan-Nordic OMXN40 index up 0.8%. "The major European stock benchmarks rose as UK stocks gained on a slide in the pound after the surprise UK general election result," Saxo Bank says in a note. "Former FBI Comey's testimony to Congress offered little evidence on alleged obstruction of justice by President Trump." Crude oil got a small bounce from shortcovering while the risk of Middle East tensions escalating further also attracted some demand ahead of the weekend, Saxo added. Oslo's oil-heavy OBX index rose 0.3%. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)

1150 ET - Digital Realty's (DLR) $5B offer for Dupont Fabros (DFT) sends DLR down a different path than the one it's mapped out for investors, adding more wholesale data center customers who rent space in bulk instead of retail buyers paying top dollar for smaller network gear deployments. But DLR says it can do both, highlighting DFT's marquee customers. They include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB), tech companies with a lot of bargaining power and voracious appetite for cloud computing resources. "It's an affirmation of when you land a customer, particularly like some of these cloud providers, how they will expand and grow," DLR investment chief Scott Peterson says in an analyst conference call. DLR down 3% to $113.31 ahead of the all-stock deal. (andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com; @drewfitzgerald)
