"You're not looking at the multiple like you used to," said Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel. "You are looking for the peace of mind that comes with not having to worry about a double-digit decline."

Among those that Mr. Siegel puts in that camp are Ross and its off-price rival TJX Cos., as well as home improvement stores Home Depot and Lowe's. Apart from Lowe's, all trade at 20 times or higher, despite expected sales growth of only 5% to 7%.

Ross and TJX have benefited from the weakness at department stores, which has given them access to higher quality merchandise. The retailers' constantly changing assortment, which shoppers dig through to find gems, also helps them avoid margin eroding e-commerce sales. While both companies' shares have underperformed the S&P 500 over the past year, they have more than doubled over the past five. Neither has reported a quarterly same-store sales decline since the end of fiscal 2009.

The story is similar for Home Depot and Lowe's which sell goods that often require a trip to a store, making them more immune than most retailers to competition from Amazon.com. Home Depot's shares have nearly tripled over the past five years, while Lowe's shares have more than doubled. Home Depot hasn't had a same-store sales decline in more than six years and Lowe's' hasn't for over three.

Investors are growing fonder of consistency. Forward multiples for Ross, TJX and Home Depot are well above their five-year averages and have been so for much of the past two years. Lowe's, where performance has lagged behind a bit, trades just below its five-year average. This premium versus the rest of retail could widen as the movement of sales online continue to take their course.

For jittery retail investors, these steady stocks may be a panacea.
