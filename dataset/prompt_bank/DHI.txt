1120 ET - Proposed tax policy changes could pose a double-edged sword for defense companies, providing relief for their relatively large pension obligations while also challenging the upward path of the Pentagon budget. Lockheed Martin among those who say they may prepay pensions at the current high rate. But a rising deficit could also crimp Pentagon spending. (doug.cameron@wsj.com)

1115 ET - House Republicans are expected to roll out a bill later today that slashes the corporate tax rate to 20% from the current 35%--something some investors and analysts believe will help juice corporate earnings growth and boost stocks. Yet some investors warn not to take the tax bill at face value. A tax plan that boosts economic growth and inflation could give the Federal Reserve a case to raise interest rates more quickly, says Charlie Diebel, head of rates at Aviva Investors , potentially upsetting the dynamic of low rates and steady growth that has helped stocks keep climbing for years. Major indexes are narrowly mixed. (akane.otani@wsj.com; @akaneotani)

1115 ET - Bunge says it's put in place severance agreements for some executive officers if the agricultural company is taken over, catching the eye of investors who've been wondering whether mining conglomerate Glencore might reapproach Bunge about a deal. Bunge disclosed the agreements, made on Wednesday, in a quarterly SEC filing late Wednesday: They provide two years' base salary and two times the annual target bonus if executives are let go by the company without cause or the executives leave "for good reason" before the second anniversary of a change of control for Bunge. Executives include Bunge's CFO and heads of its Brazil, agribusiness and food-products units. CEO Soren Schroder already had a change of control agreement. In the filing, Bunge says the move will "enhance retention and align with market practice." Bunge is up 0.7% to $70.06.(jacob.bunge@wsj.com; @jacobbunge)

1112 ET - Oilfield services firm Weatherford seems to be in perpetual comeback mode after settling bribery probes with the US Justice Department back in 2013, but the latest efforts might finally pay off. "Re-Organized, Re-Aligned, Re-Structured, -- Really Positive," says Credit Suisse after Weatherford's earnings call and a $256M 3Q loss that many analysts say were nonetheless encouraging. Credit Suisse notes Weatherford's new CEO Mark McCollum laid out his new plan which included a complete restructuring of reporting, markets and product categories, and support structure, and even removes an entire layer of senior management. "The restructuring should take $1B out of costs over the next 18-24 months," it says. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

1100 ET - Wondering how Wall Street feels about AT&T 's bold takeover of Time Warner ? Shares of T jump 2.3% in a knee-jerk reaction after a WSJ report that Justice Department is actively considering a lawsuit to challenge AT&T 's planned takeover, but quickly return near where they were trading prior to the report, down 0.8%. No decision made yet, and the two sides are still in discussions. Shares of Time Warner fall 5.4%. (marcelo.prince@wsj.com)

1051 ET - Shares of homebuilders slide after details of the House Republicans' tax bill are released, with Lennar falling 3.1%, PulteGroup down 2.4%, DR Horton down 1.4% and KB Home off 3.6%. One theory that could explain the group's fall: the GOP bill is expected to limit the home mortgage-interest deduction, according to Mohit Bajaj, director of ETF trading solutions at WallachBeth Capital, meaning buyers would only be able to deduct interest on loans up to $500,000, down from $1M today. Real-estate brokers had lobbied against removing the deduction, which they see as an important incentive for homeownership. Still, Bajaj warns against taking too much stock in the day's moves, saying the "knee-jerk reaction" in the market is likely to moderate as more details come out. (akane.otani@wsj.com; @akaneotani)

1048 ET - Investors buy bonds on expectations that reductions to tax breaks on mortgages and other popular deductions would help contain US budget deficits into the future. A limitation on the corporate deduction to the cost of interest expenses is also seen as a potential limitation to the supply of company debt, making Treasurys more attractive. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield falls to 2.347% from 2.378% Wednesday. (daniel.kruger@wsj.com)

1040 ET - Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg confirms he will be one of 40 business executives joining President Trump on next week's state visit to Asia, including a Chinese market that soaks up a fifth of the plane maker's commercial jets. Muilenburg confirmed the move in a Fox TV interview. Boeing has yet to reveal the employment details of a planned jet-finishing center near Shanghai which will paint planes destined for Chinese carriers and outfit them with seats. Some of the work will be transferred from US facilities. (doug.cameron@wsj.com; @dougcameron)

1035 ET - Exports were a bright spot for Illinois-based fertilizer maker CF, which shipped record volumes in 3Q as international prices trumped those in North America. Strong fertilizer demand in India and Brazil benefited CF, as did slowing Chinese production and shipments. A big global appetite for nitrogen fertilizer came at the right time, CF executives said on an earnings call, as North American customers are dealing with price fluctuations by buying products as they need them and maintaining lower inventories. CF is hopeful environmental reforms in China will continue to curtail production there, keeping a lid on global competition as the company works through an ongoing supply glut next year.

1032 ET - AerCap CEO says problems with the Pratt & Whitney GTF engine are a reminder to plane makers that they are manufacturing companies, having successfully built up huge backlogs of new jets. The leasing company chief expects Airbus and Boeing , having outsourced parts of their business, to reverse course to keep supply chains ticking. "We may see some crucial parts of the supply chain come back in-house," Kelly says after AerCap reported forecast-beating 3Q results. Share recently up more than 2% at another all-time high, with rival Aircastle rising more than 6.3% after its own 3Q. (doug.cameron@wsj.com; dougcameron)

1030 ET - Wells Fargo says it is planning to launch its digital cash management app in 1Q 2018 as banks race to figure out how to best serve consumers through mobile banking. Wells Fargo 's app, dubbed "Greenhouse" allows customers to open an account through their phone in minutes along with money management tools to help customers on spending and bills. Prospective customers can also use the app, says Steve Ellis, head of innovation, in an interview. It was built in less than a year, in many cases combining different services Wells Fargo already had and some new services built from scratch. The bank tested the app for months using a digital marketing firm that connected prototypes with hundreds of people on Facebook that have interest in early adoption and prototype testing, Ellis says.
