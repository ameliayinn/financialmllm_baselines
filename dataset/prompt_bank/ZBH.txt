WARSAW, Ind., Oct. 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc . (NYSE and SIX: ZBH), a global leader in musculoskeletal healthcare, today announced it is officially launching in the United States the Avenue(R) T TLIF Cage. Avenue T advances posterior lumbar cage technology by incorporating VerteBRIDGE(R) plating, which facilitates simplified cage insertion and zero-profile, intradiscal fixation through a direct, minimally invasive surgical (MIS) approach. Avenue T is the first and only posteriorly implanted cage with integrated, anti-migration fixation, solidifying Zimmer Biomet as the first company to offer a suite of lumbar cages with integrated fixation for every fusion approach. Avenue T joins a family of cages with VerteBRIDGE plating, including ROI-C(R) Cervical Cage, Avenue(R) L Lateral Lumbar Cage and ROI-A(R) ALIF Cage.

Dr. Craig Chebuhar, a board-certified orthopaedic spine surgeon in Atlanta, Georgia, who implanted one of the first Avenue T cages in the U.S., commented, "I regularly use Zimmer Biomet 's ROI-C Cervical Cage featuring VerteBRIDGE plating in my practice. Transforaminal lumbar surgery is another attractive application for integrated plating. For my TLIF patients, I appreciate the additional fixation VerteBRIDGE provides to the construct, all via a minimally invasive approach."

The Avenue T Cage is a prime example of Zimmer Biomet 's commitment to the advancement of MIS surgery. The Avenue T Cage and self-guided, curved VerteBRIDGE plating are delivered in the plane of the disc through a simplified technique. The VerteBRIDGE plates are sterile packaged and pre-assembled on a PEEK cartridge. The cartridge simplifies the technique, enabling the cage and plates to be loaded simultaneously on the Inserter. Once the cage is implanted, the Impactor advances both plates at the same time, reducing implantation steps. The unique anterior column fixation provided by the plating may permit the surgeon to select from a greater array of options for supplemental fixation.

Indications: The Avenue T TLIF Cage system is indicated for intervertebral body fusion of the lumbar spine, from L2 to S1, in skeletally mature patients who have had six months of non-operative treatment. The device is intended for use at either one level or two contiguous levels for the treatment of degenerative disc disease (DDD) with up to Grade I spondylolisthesis or retrolisthesis. DDD is defined as back pain of discogenic origin with degeneration of the disc confirmed by history and radiographic studies. The Avenue T TLIF Cage is designed for use with or without integrated fixation and must be used in conjunction with supplemental fixation cleared by FDA for use in the lumbar spine. The device is implanted via a transforaminal approach and intended for use with autograft to facilitate fusion.
