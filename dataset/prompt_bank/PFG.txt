From Principal Unit

Blackstone Group LP purchased a 4 million-square-foot portfolio of warehouses, distribution centers and other industrial property in a $500 million deal that shows that the love affair between the private-equity giant and the hot logistics sector continues, people familiar with the matter said.

Blackstone purchased the property in Southern California from Principal Real Estate Investors, the real-estate investment arm of Des Moines-based Principal Financial Group, people said.

Blackstone has been a major player in the logistics center since the early years of the post-2008 recovery, amassing huge portfolios of property in Europe and the U.S. Values of distribution centers and warehouses have been rising steadily as the economy strengthened and demand has increased from e-commerce companies.

MACERICH

Talks Held on Sale

Of Los Angeles Mall

Mall landlord Macerich Co. said it was talking to possible buyers of its Westside Pavilion, a 755,000-square-foot mall in west Los Angeles that had been suffering from weaker occupancy rates. The talks are with potential buyers that might have another use for the space.

No deal is imminent, but Art Coppola, chief executive officer at Macerich, said during the third-quarter earnings call Tuesday that the company has received interest from a number of possible buyers.

Mr. Coppola predicted Macerich will no longer own the asset within a year.
