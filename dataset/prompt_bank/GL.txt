Fitch Ratings-New York-05 November 2020:

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Ratings of Globe Life Inc . and its operating subsidiaries, which include Globe Life & Accident Insurance Co ., American Income Life Insurance Co ., United American Insurance Co ., and Liberty National Life Insurance Co . at 'A+'. Fitch has also affirmed Globe Life Inc .'s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

Key Rating Drivers

The rating affirmation reflects Globe Life's very strong and stable operating profitability, conservative operating strategy, strong capital position, consistent debt servicing capability and above-average reserve margins. Fitch views the impact of the economic fallout as material, but manageable for Globe Life, given its balance sheet composition. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that the company will continue to maintain its very strong and above-average financial returns.

Fitch views Globe Life's business profile as very strong, which considers its below-average risk profile and the lack of complexity and market risk in its liabilities. The company's strategic focus is on the sale of life and supplemental health insurance products to the middle-income market through controlled distribution, which drives its consistent and strong earnings. The company's diversification trails peers, but Globe Life lacks exposure to risky products, including long-term care insurance and variable annuities with living benefit guarantees. Favorably, Globe Life has a diversified distribution model and firmly entrenched market position.

Globe Life's financial performance and earnings remain strong. Through 9M20, the company reported a ROE of 13.6%, which exceeds expectations for the current rating level. YTD, strong and improved health results offset deterioration in the life segment due to increased mortality stemming from COVID-19. Globe Life's strong earnings are supported by below-average exposure to market and interest sensitive liabilities. Fitch expects the company will continue to generate above-average returns due to its product profile and predictable earnings streams. The uptick in mortality associated with COVID-19 is expected to remain manageable.

Fitch views Globe Life's capital position as strong, which considers its 'Strong' Prism score at YE 2019. The quality of capital is considered below-average, reflecting the high proportion of intercompany holdings. The company's estimated RBC ratio, solely accounting for YTD downgrades and credit losses, was 310% as of 9M20, which is the mid-point of its target range of 300%-320%. Financial leverage is in line with rating expectations at 26%, which includes the company's issuance of $400 million in senior notes in 3Q20.

Debt-service capability remains strong with Globe Life's fixed-charge coverage ratio of 12x based on Fitch's calculations through 9M20. Financial flexibility is considered strong, benefitting from the company's diversified funding sources and backup liquidity. Holding company liquidity is strong with liquid assets totaling $435 million as of 9M20.

Globe Life's investment portfolio is below-average in risk compared with the industry, reflecting its underweight positions in structured securities, commercial mortgage loans and private equities. The portfolio is concentrated in corporate bonds, which comprise approximately 80% of invested assets. Given this concentration, the portfolio is overweight in NAIC 2 bonds, which represent 55% of total bonds. As such, the portfolio is vulnerable to rating migration in the current environment. Fitch expects material investment losses for Globe Life over the next one to two years, but for rating downgrades to have a more meaningful impact on the portfolio.

Fitch considers Globe Life's interest rate risk as below-average compared with the industry, as its liabilities are largely illiquid, long-dated individual life insurance. The company's annuity exposure, and consequently, its disintermediation risk, are viewed as below-average. Globe Life's reserve margins are very strong and above-average, demonstrated by the company's cashflow testing results, which are positive, robust and consistent across the deterministic interest rate scenarios.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

The ratings remain sensitive to any material change in Fitch's rating case assumptions with respect to the coronavirus pandemic. Periodic updates to Fitch's assumptions are possible given the rapid pace of changes in government actions in response to the pandemic, and the pace with which new information is available on the medical aspects of the outbreak.

Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade:

--A material adverse change in Fitch's rating assumptions with respect to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic;

--Weakened financial performance, caused by outsized investment losses or poor underwriting experience, resulting in sustained GAAP based ROE metrics consistently below 10% or ROA metrics below 2%;

--Sustained deterioration in the company's capitalization that would result in a Prism capital model assessment falling to 'Adequate', increased affiliated investments activity, as well as an RBC ratio consistently below 290%;

--Financial leverage metrics consistently above 30%, along with a total financing and commitments (TFC) ratio above 0.5x and fixed-charge coverage metrics consistently below 6.0x.

Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade:

--A material positive change in Fitch's ratings assumptions with respect to the impact of the coronavirus;

--A positive rating action prefaced by Fitch's ability to reliably forecast the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the financial profile of both the North American life insurance industry and Globe Life;

--Sustained improvement in Fitch's assessment of capitalization, as defined by a Prism capital model output well into 'Strong', together with the maintenance of strong statutory reserving methodologies;

--Financial leverage metrics consistently below 25% with a TFC ratio below 0.40x;

--Continued growth across core markets, while maintaining GAAP based ROE metrics consistently in excess of 13% and fixed-charge coverage in excess of 10x.

Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario

International scale credit ratings of Financial Institutions and Covered Bond issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.

For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.

Fitch Ratings, Inc . is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (the "NRSRO"). While certain of the NRSRO's credit rating subsidiaries are listed on Item 3 of Form NRSRO and as such are authorized to issue credit ratings on behalf of the NRSRO (see https://www.fitchratings.com/site/regulatory  ), other credit rating subsidiaries are not listed on Form NRSRO (the "non-NRSROs") and therefore credit ratings issued by those subsidiaries are not issued on behalf of the NRSRO. However, non-NRSRO personnel may participate in determining credit ratings issued by or on behalf of the NRSRO.
