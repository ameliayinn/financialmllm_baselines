Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT) posted strong first-quarter sales and profit, as the world's second-largest packaged food company raised prices and cut costs enough to offset most commodity inflation. Shares rose 1.2% to $33.80 in after-hours trading, as the results topped analysts' expectations.

Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc.'s (MDRX) first-quarter earnings fell 32%, though adjusted results rose and topped analysts' estimates, as revenue increased sharply but expenses jumped and margins fell. Shares dropped 3.8% to $20.50 in recent after-hours trading.

Hansen Natural Corp.'s (HANS) first-quarter earnings jumped 69% on a sales surge, as the energy drink maker's results beat analysts' expectations. Shares were up 4.6% at $64.79 after hours.

Visa Inc.'s (V) second-quarter earnings rose 24%, beating analysts' estimates, as the company saw more transactions and benefited from higher payment volume. Visa also announced a new $1 billion stock-buyback plan. Still, shares fell 1.4% to $77.60 after hours.

Sunoco Inc.'s (SUN) first-quarter loss widened far more than expected after a series of refinery outages pulled down utilization rates in its core business. The second-largest independent refiner's shares traded down 3.6% to $38.60 after hours.

BRE Properties Inc. (BRE) plans to offer 8 million shares to repay the borrowings under its credit facility and redeem preferred stock, joining a long list of real-estate companies raising cash for acquisitions or other purposes. Shares lost 3.9% to $48.30 after hours.

Warnaco Group Inc.'s (WRC) first-quarter earnings fell 8.2% as the apparel maker's margins were lower and the company saw higher restructuring costs than a year earlier. Shares fell 4.3% to $59.25 in recent after-hours trading.

Tenaris SA's (TS, TEN.MI) first-quarter profit climbed 46% as tube sales volumes jumped, helping revenue rise sharply and boosting results above analyst expectations. Tenaris, which makes pipes used by the oil and gas industry, rose 0.06% to $46.67 after hours. 


 
Regular-Session Movers: 
 

General Motors Co.'s (GM, $32.02, -$1.02, -3.09%) first-quarter profit tripled due to stronger vehicle sales and sales of assets, including its stake in auto-parts maker Delphi Automotive LLP, but investors expressed disappointment profits weren't higher.

JDS Uniphase Corp. (JDSU, $21.38, +$1.38, +6.90%) swung to a fiscal third-quarter profit, and adjusted results rose and topped analysts' estimates, as the company saw revenue jump sharply.

Retailers are showing continued momentum, posting strong sales for April with the aid of the Easter holiday, but some caution prevails in the midst of surging gasoline prices and other uncertainties consumers face. Retailers reporting disappointing monthly same-store sales for April included J.C. Penney Co. (JCP, $37.46, -$1.96, -4.97%) and Saks Inc. (SKS, $11.27, -$0.31, -2.68%).

Among the stronger performers in same-store sales for April were Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF, $73.28, +$2.59, +3.66%), Hot Topic Inc. (HOTT, $7.30, +$0.78, +11.96%), Macy's Inc. (M, $26.35, +$0.95, +3.74%) and Ross Stores Inc. (ROST, $78.55, +$5.10, +6.94%). Ross Stores also raised its fiscal first-quarter earnings forecast.

Shares in Lloyds Banking Group PLC (LYG, $3.48, -$0.31, -8.18%) slumped after the bank reported weaker than expected first-quarter earnings and a GBP3.2 billion provision to cover payouts to customers improperly sold payment protection insurance.

Aeropostale Inc. (ARO, $21.29, -$4.20, -16.48%) trimmed its fiscal first-quarter profit outlook on lower-than-expected sales and margins, as the teen-apparel retailer's customers continue to feel pressure from the challenging economic environment.

Atmel Corp. (ATML, $14.43, -$0.32, -2.17%) shares are a little weak on light second-quarter guidance. Atmel expects revenue up 1% to 4% sequentially--putting the midpoint at $473 million. Analysts were looking for $474 million. Rival Cypress Semiconductor Corp. (CY, $20.93, +$0.65, +3.21%) projected revenue up 6% to 9% despite the sale of its image sensor business, Gleacher says, and that has some worried ATML is losing share. Gleacher believes Cypress is benefiting from timing of high-profile wins, while Atmel is just finishing inventory rebalancing. Adds Atmel is still outgrowing Cypress year-over-year.

BMC Software Inc.'s (BMC, $51.26, +$2.19, +4.46%) fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose 3.1% on better-than-expected revenue growth and wider operating margins. Adjusted earnings and the top line growth beat Wall Street's expectations.

Boston Beer Co. (SAM, $81.51, -$9.20, -10.14%), the relative giant of the craft beer category, says core shipment volume rose 10% in the first quarter but growth slowed from recent periods. While it backs its full-year view, the company warned results could take a hit if fuel costs remain elevated.

Cablevision Systems Corp.'s (CVC, $33.91, -$1.36, -3.86%) first-quarter profit jumped 40% on higher revenue as a recent acquisition boosted results. The company reported better results lately as it has added high-speed data and voice customers. But earnings per share fell short of the Street's expectations.

Cbeyond Inc.'s (CBEY, $14.23, +$1.24, +9.55%) first-quarter results topped analysts' expectations and, as a result, Stephens raised its stock-investment rating on the company to overweight from equalweight and raised its price target. Stephens said it is excited about the growth in revenue and opportunities that additional ethernet adoption could bring.

Clearwire Corp. (CLWR, $4.83, -$0.29, -5.66%), which reported a sharply wider first-quarter loss but record subscriber growth, said it has no plans to sell wireless spectrum this year after raising enough cash to operate for at least the next 12 months.

Cigna Corp.'s (CI, $47.18, +$1.26, +2.74%) first-quarter earnings rose a larger-than-expected 52% amid investment gains and other items as the managed-care company benefited from rising enrollments and lower medical costs.

Concho Resources Inc.'s (CXO, $94.00, -$3.53, -3.62%) first-quarter profit fell 37% as hedging impacts swung against the company, masking a surge in earnings amid higher production and oil prices.

Con-Way Inc. (CNW, $39.54, +$1.94, +5.16%) swung to a first-quarter profit as the less-than-truckload shipper reported progress in its effort to raise prices and shed some of the low-margin business it had taken on during the economic downturn.

US HOT STOCKS: Domino's, Estee Lauder, Murphy Oil -2-

Even though domestic same-store sales for Domino's Pizza Inc. (DPZ, $21.30, +$2.10, +10.94%) fell 1.4% in the first quarter, it comes after a 14% surge in the prior-year period. Still, the numbers show Domino's is maintaining most of the market share it gained with the rollout of a new recipe in early 2010 and first-quarter results topped analysts' estimates. Morgan Stanley notes, "Despite higher commodities, company store margins were not much below year-ago levels and improved sequentially."

Electronic Arts Inc.'s (ERTS, $21.68, +$1.76, +8.84%) fiscal fourth-quarter earnings more than quintupled, helped by tax adjustments and less impact from deferred revenue, as the videogame maker's top line increased.

Employers Holdings Inc.'s (EIG, $17.01, -$3.04, -15.16%) first-quarter profit slumped 48%, as revenue edged up 2.2% while losses and loss adjustment expenses jumped 47%, largely reflecting increasing medical and indemnity costs in California, its largest U.S. market. The results missed Wall Street's expectations.

Energy Transfer Partners LP's (ETP, $49.84, -$1.78, -3.45%) first-quarter earnings rose 3% as the company cut costs, while the owner of its general partner also saw earnings decline.

Estee Lauder Cos.'s (EL, $97.00, +$1.19, +1.24%) fiscal third-quarter earnings more than doubled, beating its own guidance, as the company benefited from a weaker U.S. dollar amid strong sales growth. The beauty-products company also raised its full-year earnings estimate.

Fortress Investment Group LLC's (FIG, $5.76, -$0.45, -7.25%) first-quarter loss widened, although "distributable" earnings rose 9% amid a bigger-than-expected increase in revenue from incentive and management fees.

Frontier Oil Corp. (FTO, $25.83, +$0.71, +2.83%) swung to a first-quarter profit as the oil refiner reported sharply higher margins for diesel and gasoline. Results easily topped analysts' expectations.

Gartner Inc.'s (IT, $38.49, -$3.63, -8.62%) first-quarter earnings jumped 50%, beating analysts' expectations, but revenue didn't climb as much as Wall Street had forecast.

Gibraltar Industries Inc. (ROCK, $13.24, +$2.31, +21.13%) swung to a first-quarter profit, topping analysts' expectations, as sales and margins improved year-on-year and sequentially.

Gulfport Energy Corp.'s (GPOR, $26.64, -$2.11, -7.34%) first-quarter earnings more than doubled as the oil-and-gas producer benefited from high oil prices, but shares were down as the result missed analysts' expectations.

Holly Corp. (HOC, $53.74, +$1.51, +2.89%) swung to a first-quarter profit as sharply higher refining margins more than offset lower volumes, and the results beat analysts' expectations.

iGate Corp.'s (IGTE, $17.81, +$1.00, +5.95%) first-quarter earnings rose 54%, though short of analysts' estimates, as clients' delayed budgets hurt revenue and the company booked costs related to its Patni Computer Systems Ltd. (532517.BY) acquisition. Revenue jumped 31% to $75.8 million.

INC Research said it will acquire contract research organization Kendle International Inc. (KNDL, $14.98, +$5.48, +57.68%) in an all-cash transaction with a total equity value of about $232 million. INC Research will acquire all outstanding shares of Kendle for $15.25 a share, representing a 60.5% premium over Kendle's closing price on May 4.

ION Geophysical Corp. (IO, $10.08, -$0.72, -6.67%) swung to a first-quarter profit as revenue edged up 2.1%, but earnings fell short of Wall Street's expectations.

Collins Stewart turned bullish on Leap Wireless International Inc. (LEAP, $16.54, +$1.47, +9.75%) even as the prepaid mobile company's first-quarter loss widened amid rising costs. The firm points to surprising improvements in subscriber gains, declining monthly churn and improved average revenue per user. The results came as some Leap Wireless shareholders have been critical of the board, saying it has destroyed shareholder value. No surprise then that management continues "to push for near-term changes that could improve shareholder value over time," Collins Stewart said. "We now believe that the management has the company back on an accelerated growth track."

MEMC Electronic Materials Inc.'s (WFR, $11.09, -$0.27, -2.38%) first-quarter loss narrowed, though adjusted results still missed analysts' estimates, as revenue jumped sharply, helped by strength in the company's solar segments.

Apparel chain Men's Wearhouse (MW, $32.04, +$4.10, +14.67%) said its fiscal first-quarter earnings-per-share will smash the company's prior view amid increased customer purchases "due to stronger-than-expected responses to the company's value offerings during the quarter."

Murphy Oil Corp.'s (MUR, $68.57, -$4.67, -6.38%) first-quarter profit surged 81% as U.S. refining margins rebounded sharply and the company reported higher oil selling prices and record natural gas production volumes. Earnings beat the company's downbeat forecast.

Following Applied Materials Inc.'s (AMAT, $14.96, -$0.13, -0.86%) high-premium bid for Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates (VSEA, $61.20, -$0.16, -0.26%), Credit Suisse suggested Novellus Systems Inc. (NVLS, $35.42, +$2.50, +7.58%) may be next, with Tokyo Electron as its purchaser. Tokyo Electron is likely evaluating its strategic options to ensure Applied Materials doesn't break away in terms of market share, the firm said, and Tokyo Electron could view an acquisition of Novellus at about $50 a share as attractive. The firm acknowledged M&A in semicap are "discrete combinations" and that "one transaction does not necessarily make all others immediately more likely." Still, it thinks sector is at the right point in the cycle for M&As "the cycle is neither too hot nor too cold."

US HOT STOCKS: Orbitz, PMI Group, Savient, Whole Foods -3-

OM Group Inc.'s (OMG, $36.73, +$2.03, +5.85%) first-quarter earnings jumped 36%, handily topping analysts' expectations, as sales increased in all three of the company's segments while manufacturing expenses dropped.

Orbitz Worldwide Inc.'s (OWW, $2.72, -$0.22, -7.48%) first-quarter loss widened on lower domestic and air-travel bookings as revenue and margins also weakened.

Penn Virginia Corp.'s (PVA, $14.03, -$0.93, -6.22%) first-quarter results sharply missed analysts' estimates due to lower liquids output and higher exploration expense.

Pericom Semiconductor Corp.'s (PSEM, $10.32, +$1.44, +16.22%) fiscal third-quarter results slightly beat analysts' expectations, and shares jumped as the supplier of high-speed integrated circuits and frequency control products forecast revenue for the fourth quarter above what the Street was estimating.

PMI Group Inc.'s (PMI, $1.74, -$0.29, -14.11%) first-quarter loss narrowed as the company saw a sharp drop in losses and loss-adjustment expenses. But results still fell way short of Wall Street's expectations.

Polypore International Inc.'s (PPO, $66.96, +$11.59, +20.93%) first-quarter profit jumped 47% as the filtration-equipment company reported strong energy storage sales and wider gross margins. The results easily topped analysts' expectations.

Developer and manufacturer of high-performance laser beam sources and laser-based solutions Rofin-Sinar Technologies Inc. (RSTI, $37.88, -$3.60, -8.68%) reported fiscal second-quarter results that missed analysts' estimates.

Savient Pharmaceuticals Inc. (SVNT, $8.57, -$2.51, -22.65%) reported headwinds in its recent launch of gout drug Krystexxa. The drug maker doesn't expect an acceleration of sales until the fourth quarter, with the major pickup not occurring until the second quarter of 2012. The drug had first-quarter sales of just $300,000, with a major issue being that it doesn't yet have a permanent billing code for Medicare, something that can make reimbursement complicated with long delays for doctors administering the expensive drug.

Smith Micro Software Inc. (SMSI, $5.66, -$1.60, -22.04%) swung to a slightly wider first-quarter loss than expected, as the company's top line plunged because of sharply reduced orders from an unnamed major customer.

Stage Stores Inc. (SSI, $17.66, -$1.42, -7.44%) lowered its bottom-line view for the first quarter and year based on its sales performance and lower-than-expected merchandise margins, even as it posted April same-store sales that topped estimates.

After its fourth-quarter results blew away analysts' estimates, Timberland Co. (TBL, $30.65, -$10.92, -26.27%) fell well short in the first quarter. The boot maker had a 8.2% rise in same-store sales, but overall revenue didn't rise as much as analysts thought. And profit surprisingly slumped as margins fell on higher product costs more that offsetting the sales gains. Those increased expenses are expected to continue the rest of the year, Timberland says, but it expects coming price increases to help.

Towers Watson & Co.'s (TW, $60.90, +$4.65, +8.27%) fiscal third-quarter earnings soared, as the company again saw significant benefits from its merger the prior year.

Tredegar Corp.'s (TG, $18.86, -$1.96, -9.41%) first-quarter profit climbed 15%, but the plastic film maker's revenue and earnings fell short of analysts' expectations.

JP Morgan raised its stock-investment rating on Trimble Navigation Ltd. (TRMB, $44.00, +$3.51, +8.67%) to overweight from neutral based on valuation. The firm said a 20% pullback since last week's first-quarter earnings creates a "growth-at-a-reasonable-price" opportunity. The GPS technology maker's first-quarter results came in slightly ahead of estimates, though second-quarter earnings guidance disappointed by a penny.

Volcano Corp. (VOLC, $27.91, +$1.53, +5.80%) gets 27% of its sales from Japan, way ahead of the average 10% among most medical-device companies, raising fears of a big sales slump due to the recent earthquake and tsunami. But the maker of imaging tools for blood vessels posted better-than-expected first-quarter sales and said, overall, it anticipates a $5 million hit from Japan this year.

Vulcan Materials Co.'s (VMC, $41.38, -$2.82, -6.38%) first-quarter loss widened as revenue edged 1.2% lower and margins narrowed. The results missed Wall Street's expectations.

Windstream Corp.'s (WIN, $12.72, -$0.50, -3.78%) first-quarter earnings fell 68% as the rural-telecom company booked debt- and acquisition-related charges. The top line missed analysts' expectations.

Whole Foods Market Inc.'s (WFMI, $59.95, +$0.21, +0.35%) fiscal second-quarter earnings grew 33% as same-store sales increased and gross margins expanded. The company said the results were the strongest it has reported in the past five years. The natural-foods supermarket chain also raised its full-year earnings estimate.

Wright Medical Group Inc. (WMGI, $15.28, -$1.05, -6.43%) said it continues an unspecified investigation as it reported several new appointments to succeed executives who resigned without "good reason."
