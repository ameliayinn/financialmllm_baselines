It is still not in GM's DNA to overpromise completely. Mr. Ammann said the goal would be met "if we continue on our current rate of change."

The conditional gives GM some room for maneuver, but this is a more concrete commitment than other car makers have made. The approach may be borrowed from Tesla Inc.'s Elon Musk, who often gives public targets even when he doesn't yet have the technology, manufacturing capacity or capital to meet them. It is unfamiliar terrain for traditional car companies, which are used to launching products years after the technology is perfected through exhaustive testing.

In pursuing autonomous driving, GM is tackling the ride-sharing market currently dominated in the U.S. by Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc., in which GM holds a stake. But it is also competing with Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo unit, which is testing its driverless technology in Chrysler minivans on the streets of Phoenix

GM's commitment to technology, combined with a more aggressive communications strategy, is starting to win recognition. The stock is up 16% over three months, better than Ford Motor Co.'s, and its price-to-earnings ratio has nudged higher. GM still gets nothing like the type of love shareholders give Tesla or Alphabet. But it is changing the conversation.
