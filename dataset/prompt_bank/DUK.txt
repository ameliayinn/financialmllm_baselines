Fitch Ratings-New York-26 October 2017: Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'BBB+' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of Duke Energy Corporation . The Rating Outlook remains Negative.

Duke's Negative Outlook reflects the high consolidated and parent leverage that was exacerbated by the company's predominantly debt-financed $5 billion acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas, Inc . in October 2016. Fitch remains uncertain about Duke's ability to lower leverage to levels acceptable for the current rating. Duke meaningfully improved its business risk profile in 2016 with the Piedmont acquisition and the sale of its unregulated Latin American power assets and used the sale proceeds to pay down some parent level debt. However, Duke's long-term parent level debt is expected to rise in 2017, and Fitch expects it to increase in each of the following two years.

Fitch will continue to monitor Duke's parent level debt, consolidated leverage metrics, and its willingness to issue equity to support credit quality. Pending rate cases at Duke's utility subsidiaries and Duke's ability to recover coal ash costs will also play a factor in Duke's ratings.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

High Consolidated and Parent Leverage: Fitch projects Duke's total adjusted debt/EBITDAR and FFO adjusted leverage to peak at 5.4x and 5.7x, respectively, in 2017. In order to maintain its 'BBB+' Long-Term IDR, Duke would need to demonstrate the ability to reduce these leverage metrics to 4.8x and 5.1x, respectively, by 2019. The percentage of holding company debt (including intermediate holdco Progress Energy, Inc .) is also high. Fitch expects holdco debt to peak at about 35% in 2017 and not fall below 31%-32% during the intermediate term.

Pending Rate Cases: Duke's utility subsidiaries have several pending rate cases, which will play a factor in determining the strength of Duke's financial profile in the near term. Duke Energy Progress, LLC (DEP) filed in June 2017 with the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) for a $477.5 million, or 14.9%, electric rate increase. Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (DEC) filed in August 2017 with the NCUC for a $611 million, or 12.8%, electric rate increase and is also seeking an additional $36 million revenue requirement increase through a proposed grid reliability and resiliency rider. These rate cases include requests to recover already incurred expenses related to coal ash remediation. The NCUC is expected to decide on the DEP rate case by Jan. 31, 2018 and the DEC rate case by the end of April 2018.

Coal Ash Remediation: Coal ash remediation will require substantial capital investment over the long-term. As of Dec. 31, 2016, Duke had an asset retirement obligation of $5.15 billion, most of which is in North Carolina at its DEC and DEP utilities. Although Fitch expects the coal ash costs to be recoverable in rates similar to other environmental capex, delays to timely cost recovery could pressure credit metrics.

High Quality Core Businesses: Duke's solid business risk profile reflects the company's ownership of primarily low-risk, regulated businesses. The company benefits from a significant amount of regulatory and geographic diversity and relatively predictable earnings and cash flow. Each of Duke's regulated electric and natural gas utilities has a solid credit profile. Investments in relatively low-risk contracted renewables and FERC-regulated electric and gas transmission projects round out the portfolio.

Constructive Regulation: Duke's utility subsidiaries operate in seven states, each of which Fitch considers to have a constructive regulatory environment. Credit quality is supported by timely recovery of costs and reasonable rates of return.

Aggressive Growth Plan: Consolidated capex is forecast to average nearly $10 billion annually through 2021, well in excess of the $7 billion average spending over 2014-2016. Regulated utility investments account for approximately 90% of the capex plan. The plan also includes investments in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, other pipeline investments and renewable generation. A significant amount of growth capex is recoverable through rider mechanisms or power purchase agreements.

DERIVATION SUMMARY

Duke Energy Corporation 's 'BBB+' Long-Term IDR is weakly-positioned relative to some of its peer parent holding companies due to the company's large amount of parent-level debt and relatively high consolidated leverage metrics. The holding company debt as a proportion of total consolidated debt at Duke is approximately 35%, which is high, compared, for example, with the 25% holding company debt figure at The Southern Company (A-/Rating Watch Negative). Duke's projected leverage metrics for 2017-2020 are weak for the rating, with projected total adjusted debt/EBITDAR in the range of 4.9x-5.4x and FFO adjusted leverage of 5.0x-5.7x. Southern Company 's projected leverage metrics of 4.7x-5.0x and 4.8x-5.1x, respectively, are slightly better than Duke's, while American Electric Power Company, Inc .'s (AEP; BBB+/Stable) projected leverage metrics of 4.1x-4.3x and 4.1x-4.3x, respectively, are significantly stronger. Duke's geographic and regulatory diversity and business mix is similar to that of Southern Company .

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Duke include:

--$49 billion five-year capex plan;

--Ash pond remediation costs are recoverable from ratepayers;Â

--Current rider mechanisms remain in effect;

--Balanced rate case decisions consistent with prior outcomes;

--Normal weather.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action

--A positive rating action is not likely given the high level of parent debt and expected increase in consolidated leverage. Ratings could be affirmed with a Stable Outlook if Fitch were to expect adjusted total debt/EBITDAR to improve to 4.8x and FFO adjusted leverage to improve to 5.1x by 2019. Factors that could support favorable resolution of the Negative Outlook include management's willingness to reduce parent-level debt through equity issuances or other means, constructive rate case decisions in North Carolina, and clarity regarding Duke's ability to recover coal ash costs.

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action

--Ratings could be downgraded if Fitch were to expect adjusted total debt/EBITDAR and FFO adjusted leverage to exceed 4.8x and 5.1x, respectively, on a sustainable basis after 2019. Factors playing into a rating downgrade include continued high leverage, a deterioration of the regulatory environment in North Carolina, and an inability to recover coal ash costs.

LIQUIDITY

Fitch considers Duke's liquidity to be adequate. Duke and its utility subsidiaries primarily meet their short-term liquidity needs through a $4.85 billion commercial paper (CP) program that is supported by an $8 billion committed master credit facility (MCF). The MCF is used to issue CP, letters of credit and variable-rate demand tax-exempt bonds. The facility includes borrowing sub-limits for Duke and its subsidiaries, each of which is party to the MCF. Duke has the unilateral ability to at any time increase or decrease the borrowing sub-limits for each borrower, within specified limits. The termination date of the MCF is March 16, 2022.

At June 30, 2017, Duke had $3,115 million of CP outstanding, $68 million of outstanding letters of credit and $81 million of tax-exempt bonds issued under the MCF. In addition, $500 million of available capacity is set aside to meet obligations related to violations at North Carolina facilities with ash basins. Unencumbered available capacity was $4,236 million at June 30, 2017.

Duke and its subsidiaries participate in a corporate money pool that supports short-term borrowing needs. Duke may lend funds to the pool, but may not borrow from the pool. Duke's CP program and excess utility cash are the primary source of funds for the money pool.

The holding company also has a $1 billion revolving credit facility that matures June 2020. As of June 30, 2017, $270 million was drawn under the three-year revolver.
