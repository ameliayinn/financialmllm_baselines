1142 GMT - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals reports a 29% increase in sales of cholesterol drug Praluent in 3Q. Last month, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Regeneron and Sanofi SA , who both receive profits from the drug, could keep selling it, but asked for a new trial. Amgen , who offers a competing cholesterol drug called Repatha, had said the companies violated its patents. As of February, Regeneron and Sanofi SA were allowed to keep selling Praluent while the case was being appealed. In Amgen 's third-quarter earnings last month, sales of Repatha were $89M, up more than double from $40M the year before. Amgen 's overall product sales fell slightly. Shares rise 3.6% premarket.(allison.prang@wsj.com; @AllisonPrang)

0436 GMT - Amazon is giving diapers another shot. It's started offering customers a preview of its new private-label Mama Bear diapers, priced lower than P&G 's Pampers. Amazon tried diapers a couple years ago, but scrapped them for reasons that are unclear. Private label is a growing driver of sales for the online retail giant, however.
