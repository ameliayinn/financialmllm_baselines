Boston Properties Announces Third Quarter 2017 Results 


BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 01, 2017-- 

Boston Properties, Inc . (NYSE: BXP), a real estate investment trust and one of the largest owners, managers and developers of Class A office properties in the United States, reported results today for the third quarter ended September 30, 2017. 


   -- Net income attributable to common shareholders was $117.3 million 
      compared to $76.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 
 
   -- Net income attributable to common shareholders per share (EPS) was $0.76 
      basic and $0.76 on a diluted basis, compared to $0.50 basic and $0.50 on 
      a diluted basis for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 
 
   -- Funds from Operations (FFO) were $243.0 million, or $1.57 per share basic 
      and $1.57 per share diluted. This compares to FFO of $219.6 million, or 
      $1.43 per share basic and $1.42 per share diluted, for the quarter ended 
      September 30, 2016. 
   -- FFO of $1.57 per share diluted was greater than the mid-point of the 
      Company's guidance previously provided of $1.52 - $1.54 per share diluted 
      primarily due to: 
   -- $0.02 per share of additional development and management services 
      revenue; 
 
   -- $0.01 per share due to better than expected portfolio operations; and 
 
   -- $0.01 per share of less than projected general and administrative 
      expenses. 
   -- The Company provided its guidance for full year 2018 EPS and FFO per 
      share as follows: 
   -- Projected EPS (diluted) for 2018 of $2.55 - $2.71 per share; and 
 
   -- Projected FFO per share (diluted) for 2018 of $6.20 - $6.36 per share. 
   -- Development Highlights - Signed leases and commenced development of the 
      new office headquarters for Marriott International, Inc . and the 
      Transportation Security Administration  ("TSA") aggregating 1.4 million 
      square feet, and fully placed in-service 888 Boylston Street, a 417,000 
      square foot office building development that is 93% leased. 

The reported results are unaudited and there can be no assurance that these reported results will not vary from the final information for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. In the opinion of management, the Company has made all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of these reported results.

At September 30, 2017, the Company's portfolio consisted of 177 properties aggregating approximately 49.8 million square feet, including ten properties under construction/redevelopment totaling approximately 5.7 million square feet. The overall percentage of leased space for the 164 properties in service (excluding the Company's two residential properties and hotel) as of September 30, 2017 was 90.2%.

Significant events during the third quarter included:

Development activities 


   -- On August 7, 2017, the Company entered into a joint venture with The 
      Bernstein Companies to develop an approximately 722,000 net rentable 
      square foot (subject to adjustment based on finalized building design) 
      build-to-suit Class A office building and below-grade parking garage at 
      7750 Wisconsin Avenue in Bethesda, Maryland. The joint venture entered 
      into a lease agreement with an affiliate of Marriott International, Inc ., 
      under which Marriott will lease 100% of the office building and garage 
      for a term of 20 years, and the building will serve as Marriott's new 
      worldwide headquarters. Marriott has agreed to fund 100% of the related 
      tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions for the office building. 
      The Company will serve as co-development manager for the venture and 
      expects to commence construction in 2018. The Company and The Bernstein 
      Companies each own a 50% interest in the joint venture. 
 
   -- On August 24, 2017, the Company entered into a 15-year lease with the 
      General Services Administration , under which the Company will develop the 
      new headquarters for the TSA. The TSA will occupy 100% of the 
      approximately 623,000 net rentable square feet of Class A office space 
      and a parking garage at 6595 Springfield Center Drive located in 
      Springfield, Virginia. Concurrently with the execution of the lease, the 
      Company commenced development of the project and expects the building to 
      be available for occupancy by the fourth quarter of 2020. 
 
   -- On September 16, 2017, the Company completed and fully placed in-service 
      888 Boylston Street, a Class A office and retail project with 
      approximately 417,000 net rentable square feet located in Boston, 
      Massachusetts. The property is 93% leased. 

Acquisition and disposition activities 


   -- On August 30, 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Reston Eastgate 
      property located in Reston, Virginia for a gross sale price of $14.0 
      million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $13.2 million, resulting 
      in a gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $2.8 million. 
      Reston Eastgate is a parcel of land containing approximately 21.7 acres 
      located at 11011 Sunset Hills Road. 

Capital markets activities 


   -- On July 28, 2017, a joint venture in which the Company has a 50% interest 
      obtained mortgage financing collateralized by its Colorado Center 
      property located in Santa Monica, California totaling $550.0 million. The 
      mortgage financing bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.56% per annum and 
      matures on August 9, 2027. The loan requires interest-only payments 
      during the 10-year term of the loan, with the entire principal amount due 
      at maturity. The joint venture distributed $502.0 million to the partners, 
      of which the Company's share was $251.0 million. Colorado Center is a 
      six-building office complex that sits on a 15-acre site and contains an 
      aggregate of approximately 1,118,000 net rentable square feet with an 
      underground parking garage for 3,100 vehicles. 
 
   -- On September 6, 2017, a joint venture in which the Company has a 50% 
      interest obtained construction financing with a total commitment of 
      $204.6 million collateralized by its Hub on Causeway development project. 
      The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to 
      LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum and matures on September 6, 2021, with two, 
      one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions. As of 
      September 30, 2017, the venture had not drawn any funds under the loan. 
      The Hub on Causeway is an approximately 385,000 net rentable square foot 
      project containing retail and office space located in Boston, 
      Massachusetts. 

EPS and FFO per Share Guidance:

The Company's guidance for the fourth quarter 2017, full year 2017 and full year 2018 for EPS (diluted) and FFO per share (diluted) is set forth and reconciled below. Except as described below, the estimates reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including assumptions with respect to rental rates, occupancy levels and the earnings impact of the events referenced in this release and otherwise referenced during the conference call referred to below. The estimates do not include possible future gains or losses or the impact on operating results from other possible future property acquisitions or dispositions, other possible capital markets activity or possible future impairment charges. EPS estimates may be subject to fluctuations as a result of several factors, including changes in the recognition of depreciation and amortization expense and any gains or losses associated with disposition activity. The Company is not able to assess at this time the potential impact of these factors on projected EPS. By definition, FFO does not include real estate-related depreciation and amortization, impairment losses on depreciable real estate or gains or losses associated with disposition activities. There can be no assurance that the Company's actual results will not differ materially from the estimates set forth below.

As set forth below, the Company has updated its projected EPS (diluted) for the full year 2017 to $2.80 - $2.81 per share from $2.72 - $2.77 per share. This is an increase of approximately $0.06 per share at the mid-point of the Company's guidance consisting of $0.02 per share of better than expected portfolio performance and additional development services revenue, $0.02 per share of lower depreciation and amortization expense, and $0.02 per share resulting from an unbudgeted land sale during the third quarter of 2017. In addition, the Company has updated its projected guidance for FFO per share (diluted) for the full year to $6.24 - $6.25 per share from $6.20 - $6.25 per share. This is an increase of approximately $0.02 per share at the mid-point of the Company's guidance primarily consisting of better than expected portfolio performance and additional development services revenue.

Press Release: Boston Properties  Announces Third -2-

The Company's guidance for the full year 2018 for EPS (diluted) and FFO per share (diluted) is set forth and reconciled below. When compared to the full year 2017, the estimates for 2018 include, among other assumptions, (1) an incremental contribution of $0.26 per share at the mid-point from development deliveries and (2) an increase in the Company's Share of Same Property net operating income ("NOI") (excluding termination income) of 0.5% to 2.5% resulting in an incremental $0.13 per share at the mid-point of the range. These items are partially offset by (1) an increase in net interest expense (including the Company's share of unconsolidated joint venture debt at Colorado Center) of $0.17 per share at the mid-point, (2) a decrease in lease termination fees of $0.10 per share at the mid-point, (3) an increase in depreciation expense primarily due to development deliveries of $0.07 per share, (4) an increase in noncontrolling interests in property partnerships of $0.05 per share at the mid-point, (5) an increase in G & A expense of $0.03 per share at the mid-point and (6) a decrease in development and management services revenue of $0.01 per share at the mid-point.

Press Release: Boston Properties  Announces Third -4-

(1) Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), we calculate Funds from Operations, or "FFO," by adjusting net income (loss) attributable to Boston Properties, Inc . common shareholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, impairment losses on depreciable real estate consolidated on our balance sheet, impairment losses on our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and real estate-related depreciation and amortization. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure, but we believe the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO and FFO per share to be useful measures for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO per share can help investors compare the operating performance of a company's real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies.

Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently.

In order to facilitate a clear understanding of the Company's operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc . common shareholders as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements. FFO should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc . common shareholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the Company's financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
