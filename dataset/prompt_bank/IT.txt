BlackBerry is entering a highly competitive field, with some of the world's biggest tech companies investing in autonomous-vehicle research. Still, the company's QNX push has yielded some early results, including tie-ups with Ford Motor Co. and Aptiv PLC, the General Motors Co. spinoff formerly known as Delphi Automotive PLC.

A possible deal with Tata Motors Ltd.'s Jaguar Land Rover unit is in the works.

In September, the company began a marketing campaign with billboards in Silicon Valley and Detroit showing a car and the tag line "Is Your Car BlackBerry Secure?" with the aim of promoting its technology as a way to protect autonomous vehicles from hacking.

Over the long term, "the auto sector is our best chance at revenue growth," BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen said in an interview. Mr. Chen will deliver a keynote address next month at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.

The company has struggled to find its footing in recent years after losing out to phones made by Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. BlackBerry once counted 80 million phone subscribers using its email service, according to the company.

Its customer base evaporated after employers began allowing workers to use personal devices, and its market capitalization plunged from a peak of 79.5 billion Canadian dollars ($61.7 billion) in 2008 to C$3.24 billion in late 2013.

BlackBerry sells phones sourced from third-party manufacturers after it stopped making them last year; but the number is so small that research firm Gartner Inc. measured BlackBerry's share of the global device market at 0.0%. The company's other main business, software management for phones, currently provides the bulk of its revenue, though analysts say it is appearing to plateau.

In 2010, BlackBerry bought QNX from Harman International Industries Inc. -- which was acquired earlier this year by Samsung -- to help bolster the operating system for its BB10 devices. The aim was to include enough features to draw interest away from iPhones and Android-supported phones, but the new BlackBerry devices failed to catch on and the company shifted its engineering resources back to its QNX division as car makers started developing software.

A successful turnaround pinned to QNX could make BlackBerry attractive to a potential buyer, said Todd Coupland, a technology analyst with CIBC World Markets, adding that "it will first need to announce more self-driving wins to legitimize its position in the market."

One possible sign that investors are taking note of the software initiatives: BlackBerry's shares are trading just under $11, up about half on the year.

If the stock continues to rise, BlackBerry's two biggest shareholders -- Pasadena, Calif.-based Primecap Management Corp. and Toronto-based Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. -- could support a potential sale that would allow them to recoup an investment that has long performed poorly, people familiar with the matter said. The two shareholders combined own about one-quarter of the company's shares.

In recent years, BlackBerry's large library of mobile, encryption and QNX patents has drawn interest, the people said. However, they added that Mr. Chen has rebuffed several takeover feelers as inadequate and BlackBerry's major shareholders have backed him.
