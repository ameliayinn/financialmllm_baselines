1412 ET - Companies nervous about negotiations with Canada and Mexico are mulling options to prevent the Trump administration from pulling out Nafta, according to a former US trade official. "A number of companies have started to look down that path for a Plan B," said Kellie Meiman, managing partner at DC-based consulting firm McLarty Associates and a former US Trade Representative official during the Clinton Administration. Speaking at a seminar in Detroit on Wednesday, Meiman said options include lobbying for legislation requiring Congressional consultation or an International Trade Commission impact study, she said. Another possibility is a constitutional challenge to Section 151 of the Trade Act of 1974, which grants presidential termination and withdrawal authority, she said.

1405 ET - At an investor conference Wednesday, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said Sprint 's network, while improved in recent years, is nowhere near its potential. Now that it won't be merging with T-Mobile , Claure says Sprint will spend billions of dollars more each year on network improvements, such as installing 2.5 GHz spectrum on all its towers. That means capex will rise as it spends more of its cash reserves. Claure said customers are more likely to leave if they live in places where the network doesn't work well. Because it's network isn't as good as rivals, "I don't think we've given Sprint fully the right chance to compete," he said. (Ryan.Knutson@wsj.com)

1241 ET - Analysts are asking if Wendy's --which reported 3Q earnings Wednesday--is struggling with its market share. AllianceBernstein says in a research note that the company's two big competitors, Burger King and McDonald's , had better comps for the quarter, "suggesting (Wendy's ) may be struggling to hold share amidst value onslaught." RBC Capital Markets says Wendy's could be seeing the impact from Carrols Restaurant Group , which owns almost 800 US Burger King restaurants. "Our guess is that Carrol's geographic footprint--being primarily in the Northeast--has hurt Wendy's , which seemed to imply a slight slowdown in the first half of 4Q." In Wendy's conference call Wednesday, CEO Todd Penegor says, "We continue to hold our own." (allison.prang@wsj.com; @AllisonPrang)

1237 ET - Imports of foreign-made steel to the US rose 12% in September to 3.1M tons, as the US's closest trading partners stepped up their shipments. Imports from Mexico, Canada and the European Union rose by 30%, 20% and 28% respectively from year earlier, says the American Iron and Steel Institute and industry forecaster Bradford Research. Imports from China, which has been widely criticized in recent years for flooding the world market with its steel, dropped nearly 40% in September as a result of steep US tariffs and higher prices for steel inside China. While steel company executives continue to urge the Trump Administration to impose board-based tariffs on imports, several have asked Canada and Mexico be to spared. US steel producers rely on mills in the Nafta countries to supply steel to US customers and US mills. (robert.tita@wsj.com)

1214 ET - Equifax 's interim chief executive Paulino do Rego Barros says he doesn't know if certain consumer data on Equifax 's systems is unencrypted at rest in questioning from Sen Cory Gardner (R, Colo) at a Senate committee hearing. Barros has been the company's interim CEO since late Sept.

1200 ET - The Equifax hearing in the Senate Commerce Committee is now focusing on a lingering question: the role of John J Kelley , Equifax's chief legal officer, in approving stock trades by company executives in the days after the company first discovered suspicious activity in its systems. A special committee of Equifax 's board said the executives didn't know about the suspicious activity when they sold stock, but didn't address what Kelley knew at the time. People familiar with the matter have told The Wall Street Journal that Kelley was informed of the suspicious activity July 30, before the executives sold their shares. Sen Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc, called the situation "totally inappropriate." Pauiino de Rego Barros Jr, Equifax 's interim CEO, said "I think it's not my perspective to say whether it's appropriate or not" and noted that the special committee is still investigating the process.

1150 ET - The time may have come for Texas oilmen to ditch the popular expression "we've been through this rodeo before," which was often heard after the 2014 collapse in oil prices. Shan Jegatheeswaran, VP of sales operations and commercial integration at Baker Hughes, says young people new to the industry should instead lead innovation efforts to change operations, designs and equipment "to build a product that is truly superior in the current state." Speaking at the Operational Excellence oil and gas conference in Houston, he says many people have been in the oil business longer than he's been alive, and says the solution to price slumps or other problems can no longer be "we'll figure it out, we've been through this cycle before."
