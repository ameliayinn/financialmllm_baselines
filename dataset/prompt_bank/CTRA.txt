1220 ET - Goldman Sachs continues to see risk and reward favoring dollar shorts through next year. "Vaccine development appears to be making good progress, consistent with our base case of approval by year-end, and additional headway should further lift cyclical assets as markets price in stronger growth closer to our own expectations," the firm says. "The policy backdrop should also remain favorable for risky assets as central banks around the world keep rates on hold and continue QE programs, combined with likely additional fiscal stimulus in the US--albeit smaller than expected under a 'blue wave' scenario." Goldman sees commodities benefiting from boosted demand, supporting emergence of a new bull cycle in 2021, with oil and copper supporting the Canadian and Australian dollars, respectively.

1152 ET - Goldman Sachs is still expecting more government help for an ailing economy: "Our base case for additional stimulus remains the same: roughly $1 trillion in additional fiscal measures, most of which would be spent in 2021." In a note, the firm acknowledged very complicated politics around achieving a new package, but even so, it sees renewed enhanced jobless benefits, more paycheck protection aid and some help for local governments. That said, "it is also very unclear what President Trump would be willing to sign before he leaves office, and the continued disagreement over the election result has made negotiations more difficult," the firm says.

1131 ET - US benchmark oil prices slightly reduce earlier gains after a weekly EIA report shows an unexpected 4.3M-bbl increase in US oil inventories. A WSJ survey was forecasting a 700k-bbl decline, while trade group API reported a huge, 5.1M-bbl drop, which made today's reported increase even more surprising. But the data also included some quite bullish numbers, as gasoline and distillate fuels fell by a combined 7.7M bbls. Also, US oil production stayed at a relatively low 10.5M bpd, and implied gasoline demand jumped to 8.8M bpd, 426k bpd more than the previous week, and just 559k bpd less than its pre-coronavirus level one year ago. WTI crude trades 0.7% higher at $41.81/bbl. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

1126 ET - American expects to boost its cash pile from upcoming aircraft deliveries, likely via sale leaseback deals where it sells planes on order to leasing companies and rents them back. President Robert Isom says at an investor event that all deliveries in 2020 and 2021 are fully financed, and will likely generate rather than drain cash. It will take some Boeing 737 MAX jets in December if regulators approve return to flight by then. It has 18 already built and another 18 slated to arrive through the end of next year.

1120 ET - The largest shareholder in Agco says the farm equipment maker should separate the duties of the chief executive and chairman as it transitions from retiring Chairman and CEO Martin Richenhagen to incoming CEO Eric Hansotia on Jan. 1. In a regulatory filing, Indian tractor maker TAFE, which holds about 16% of Agco's shares and whose Chairman Mallika Srinivasan is a longtime Agco director, says the separation would improve corporate governance. It's also calling for an overhaul of the board's practices, including rotating memberships on board committees, better alignment of top management's compensation with the company's performance and an increased focus on long-term strategy. Shares rise 2% at $90.01. (robert.tita@wsj.com; @bob_tita)

1104 ET - With plenty of good news flowing from MasterCraft's fiscal 1Q results, the company still looks attractively valued even as shares are up more than 45% year to date, Raymond James analysts write. Retail demand has been strong while supply-chain difficulties during the pandemic have been manageable, Raymond James says, and the likely persistence of low interest rates should continue to help shoppers finance recreational boats. Though production rates have exceeded pre-Covid levels at MasterCraft's facilities, retail momentum has kept inventory taut. Raymond James raises its price target to $25.50, from $22.00. MasterCraft shares fall 4.1% to $22.81. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)

1026 ET - New-vehicle production delays during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic drove up prices for used cars over the summer, but prices are sliding back toward more normal levels, as per data from Edmunds. The average value of trade-in vehicles in October was $15,874, down by 3.3% from September. The average October value of three-year-old vehicles was $20,401, down 1.7% from the previous month. Supply issues from earlier this year are easing and more lease returns are also upping the quantity of near-new inventory, according to Edmunds. "We're finally hitting the tipping point in the used-car market," Edmunds analyst Ivan Drury says. ( matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)

1022 ET - Contura Energy is offloading assets in Pennsylvania tied to thermal coal, used in electricity generation, in part by paying a buyer to take them on. The coal miner says it agreed to pay $20M in cash to sell the Cumberland Mine and related entities to Iron Senergy Holding and transfer $30M in cash collateral to Iron Senergy's surety provider, funds that will serve as collateral for mine reclamation bonds. In exchange, Iron Senergy will assume future reclamation expenses tied to the assets, estimated at $169M in undiscounted cash flows, and other obligations. Contura has faced investor pressure to exit thermal coal, demand for which is falling, and miner Arch Resources is also seeking to sell those assets and focus on coal used in steelmaking.

1015 ET - Edgewell Personal Care 's feminine-care sales in 4Q fell nearly 11% due to Walmart 's rearrangement of store products, it says. "We know the path back to a flat top-line risk category will take time and require better brand activation and execution at retail," CEO Rod Little says. Meanwhile, sales in women's shaving products grew as those for men fell 4%, the company says. Edgewell's investment in shaving products "probably skews a little heavier towards women's," Little says. Sales of sun and skincare products rose 15% as overall sales fell 7.4%. Shares rise 4.3%. (dave.sebastian@wsj.com; @depsebastian)

1006 ET - Auto makers sold 7.6M new vehicles globally in October, a 2.3% increase from the same month a year ago, according to industry firm LMC Automotive. Markets in the US and Asia showed the strongest growth, while slowing sales in western Europe amid the continent's reemergent Covid-19 outbreaks weighed on the global recovery. Auto maker executives have stressed in recent days that despite posting generally strong 3Q results, the ongoing pandemic still poses a major threat to their business. (ben.foldy@wsj.com)

0933 ET - The Trump administration has put economic pressure on Cuba, including through curbs on tourism, and it will be up to the incoming Biden administration to determine the future of US-Cuba relations as part of its expected efforts to reverse Trump-era policies. The US last year barred American cruise ships, yachts, sailboats and private flights from going to Cuba. "While no specifics were given, we think it's reasonable that Cuba-U.S. travel could be resumed, which would be ideal for a cruise restart," Credit Suisse says. The bank says Cuba contributed about 4% to Norwegian Cruise Line 's itineraries before the ban. (dave.sebastian@wsj.com; @depsebastian)
