1605 ET - Zynga raises its full-year outlook after reporting 3Q all-time record revenue and bookings above guidance, saying it expects to keep growing due to the strength of its portfolio, which includes games gained through recent acquisitions of studios such as Istanbul-based Rollic.

Zynga now expects to end 2020 with record full-year revenue and bookings of $1.93B and $2.24B, respectively.

1605 ET - Another group of companies facing a tough day due to the election: construction-materials suppliers, where investors had been anticipating a stronger Democratic showing and thus larger fiscal stimulus and infrastructure efforts. Should Republicans keep control of the Senate, "you're not in the blue-sky scenario for infrastructure," says Rohit Seth, who follows the group for Truist. "Stocks were pricing in a very bullish scenario." Still, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did say Wednesday that Congress should pass a new economic-relief package this year, though that legislation is likely to be smaller than what Democrats had hoped for. Shares of Martin Marietta Materials lose 8.1%, while Vulcan Materials ' stock slumps 9.2%. (micah.maidenberg@wsj.com; @MicahMaidenberg)

1603 ET - "Doing nothing may be the best thing to do right now," Ally Invest's Lindsey Bell says as Americans wait to see who will be the next president. "We expect markets to be especially sensitive to headlines over the next few days," she says, while offering some soothing statistics. "The S&P 500 has been positive in 16 out of the last 19 presidential cycles, and the three that weren't, overlapped with economic downturns. Today, the economy is growing and we're optimistic about 2021." Bell notes ups and downs are to be expected. "Stimulus developments, coronavirus cases and potential treatment will still be important market movers near-term," she says. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)

1558 ET - Brinks is anticipating stricter emission standards for its fleet of armored trucks should Biden win the US presidential election, finance chief Ron Domanico says. The company, which moves money for banks and retailers, has about 7,000 trucks in the US and might have to retire some of these early in case of changing emission regulations, Domanico says. Costs for operating the fleet could go up because of potentially higher fuel prices under a Biden administration, he says. The company could be required to expand its reporting on environmental, social and governance issues if there was a change in government, he says. "We currently do ESG reporting, but we would have to extend that," Domanico says. (nina.trentmann@wsj.com; @Nina_Trentmann)

1549 ET - A tenth of Hilton Worldwide Holdings ' business for 3Q came from group travel, about half the proportion of what it would take in before the pandemic, CEO Christopher Nassetta says. It took in group demand from sports teams, he says. "It's not the traditional customer en masse that we would typically be housing, but business travel is picking up," Nassetta says on a conference call. The company says it expects a 4% to 5% net unit growth, or NUG, for the year. "Despite the limited visibility into near-term business and group travel, the improving RevPAR and continued NUG are positive bases for recovery and furtherance of the financial merits of the business model," Jefferies says.

1522 ET - Catherine Keating , the CEO of Bank of New York Mellon's wealth management division, says her team has been having calls about the election with clients for months about the presidential election and stressing the need for patience. The bank's clients, which tend to be ultra-high net worth individuals are invested for the long term, but are still relying on the bank for market guidance today, Keating says. Bankers are telling them that a divided government tends to be good for markets, there is less likelihood of dramatically higher taxes for companies and individuals and there is less likelihood of a multi-trillion-dollar stimulus bill.
