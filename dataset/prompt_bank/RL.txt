Tiffany said its board is "committed to our current core business strategies, but has been disappointed by recent financial results." The company reiterated its recent financial forecasts and said it needed to accelerate its execution to improve its performance.

Shares of Tiffany, which have underperformed the broader market, closed Friday at $80.47, little changed from when Mr. Cumenal took the helm.

The luxury brand has posted declining same-store sales for several quarters, hurt by diminished spending by foreign tourists as the stronger dollar has made such shopping trips more expensive.

Last month, the company reported a 4% drop in North American same-store sales for the holidays, which it blamed on lower foot traffic to its flagship Fifth Avenue store. The company highlighted traffic disruptions and security around its neighbor, Trump Tower, where the new president was meeting with various leaders.

Mr. Cumenal said he didn't expect a material improvement in the macroeconomic challenges the company faced in 2016. The company's revenue has been flat at about $4 billion since 2014.

Tiffany is the latest luxury company to undergo an executive shake-up, underscoring the pressure on established brands to reinvent themselves for a fast-changing market, where social media allows upstarts to quickly gain a footing and consumers are no longer loyal. Last week, Ralph Lauren Corp. said its chief executive, Stefan Larsson, will leave the company in May after less than two years on the job due to creative differences with the company's founder.

Mr. Cumenal joined Tiffany in 2011 to oversee sales and distribution, and was appointed president and joined the board in 2013. The Frenchman was hired from LVMH, where he had been CEO of Moet & Chandon SA.

Mr. Kowalski, who joined the company in 1983, was the CEO of Tiffany from 1999 until he handed over the top spot to Mr. Cumenal in April 2015.
