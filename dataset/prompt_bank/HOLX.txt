SLM swung to a third-quarter profit as interest-rate spreads returned to more normal levels. Shares of SLM surged 10.1% to $9.80 in after-hours trading. The stock has nearly tripled since March, but it is still well off levels seen before the financial crisis hit last year.

Cree Inc.'s (CREE) fiscal first-quarter profit more than tripled on surging margins and revenue as the semiconductor and light-emitting-diode, or LED, lighting company easily topped estimates.

   Regular Session Movers: 
 

Apple Inc.'s (AAPL, $198.76, +$8.90, +4.69%) fiscal fourth-quarter profit jumped 47% as the company sold more Macintosh computers and iPhones than in any previous quarter, which helped drive revenue. The company's latest results easily beat analysts' expectations.

Astec Industries (ASTE, $25.61, -$1.86, -6.77%) shares dropped after third-quarter results fell well short of analyst expectations. Chief Executive J. Don Brock said he is disappointed with results, pointing to softness in the residential and commercial real estate markets, and uncertainty until a Congressional renewal of a highway bill. Astec sees little improvement in domestic sales during the fourth quarter and next year until Congress acts, Brock added.

Nomura upgraded its stock investment rating on Bank of Ireland (IRE, $16.59, +$0.67, +4.21%) to buy from neutral. In a note to clients, the firm said the bank reported that its National Asset Management Agency-related loans are of significantly better quality than the Irish average. Nomura added the company's shares are among the most geared to available-for-sale write-backs in the sector.

Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK, $28.90, +$1.67, +6.13%) unexpectedly swung to a third-quarter loss on $4.8 billion of investment losses at the asset manager and securities adviser. But shares rose as investors may see it as a positive that it unloaded risky assets - and that it could sell them at all.

Shares of Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX, $8.57, -$1.59, -15.65%) dropped after the company pointed to challenges facing markets for its top heart devices, implantable defibrillators and drug-coated stents. The company issued weaker results than Wall Street expected late Monday while it sliced its full-year earnings guidance. On a conference call Tuesday, the company noted pressure on device prices and the potential negative impact of recent stent studies, plus a softened growth outlook within the market for heart-rhythm devices. Shares of St. Jude Medical Inc. (STJ, $33.16, -$1.12, -3.27%) also fell.

Baird raised its rating on Briggs & Stratton Corp. (BGG, $22.52, +$2.24, +11.05%) to outperform, saying it likes the potential for a "robust cyclical recovery," renewed focus on growth with a new CEO and improved profitability and cash flow.

Brinker International Inc.'s (EAT, $14.65, -$1.86, -11.27%) fiscal first-quarter earnings fell 34% amid prior-year gains, as results topped the company's dour forecast and consumers continued to eat out less. Shares dropped as the restaurant operator continues to see consumer weakness and plans to invest in a new menu, equipment and training at its Chili's Grill & Bar to wean customers off discounts. DineEquity Inc. (DIN, $23.25, -$1.72, -6.89%), Cheesecake Factory Inc. (CAKE, $18.98, -$0.78, -3.95%) and California Pizza Kitchen Inc. (CPKI, $14.17, -$1.01, -6.65%) also traded lower.

Caterpillar Inc.'s (CAT, $59.61, +$1.76, +3.04%) third-quarter profit fell 53%, still beating analyst estimates, as the company said it likely has seen the bottom in sales as dealers continued to slash inventories during the economic downturn. The company also narrowed its 2009 forecast, putting revenue at the lower end of its prior view.

Conn's Inc. (CONN, $8.02, -$4.02, -33.39%) withdrew its previous earnings guidance and said it's discontinuing the practice of providing earnings guidance following underwhelming sales growth in the first two months of its third quarter. The company said it may report a loss for the third-quarter, but expects to be "solidly profitable" during its fourth-quarter.

DiamondRock Hospitality Co.'s (DRH, $8.42, -$0.32, -3.66%) third-quarter profit slumped 94% on lower revenue and occupancy rates, but the real estate company narrowly avoided swinging to a loss and topped Wall Street's expectations.

Videogame stocks fell Tuesday as the release of disappointing September sales data sparked worries about the rest of the year. Electronic Arts Inc. (ERTS, $19.97, -$0.86, -4.13%), THQ Inc. (THQI, $5.77, -$0.10, -1.70%) and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO, $10.88, -$0.33, -2.94%) all declined, as did game retailer GameStop Corp. (GME, $25.65, -$2.51, -8.91%), which was cut to neutral from buy by Janney Montgomery Scott. Janney said tepid software sales are crushing expectations for the company amid near-term compression in the gaming cycle and economic pressure.

First Cash Financial Services Inc. (FCFS, $18.32, +$0.95, +5.47%) rose after the check-cashing store posted better-than-expected third-quarter results and raised its 2009 earnings forecast. Sterne Agee upgraded its rating to buy from neutral after earnings, citing continued growth in Mexico, decreasing reliance on U.S. payday revenue and the expectation First Cash will be debt free by the middle of 2011.

Forest Laboratories Inc.'s (FRX, $28.96, -$1.29, -4.26%) fiscal second-quarter profit fell 23% on acquisition-related charges as sales of its Namenda treatment for Alzheimer's disease and dementia rose while its star depression fighter, Lexapro, fell.

Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co.'s (GAP, $9.78, -$1.59, -13.98%) fiscal second-quarter loss widened amid a prior-year gain while joblessness, price competition and deflation made business hard for the supermarket operator.

Shares of Hologic Inc. (HOLX, $15.69, -$0.96, -5.77%) fell after the head of General Electric Co.'s (GE, $15.58, -$0.26, -1.64%) health-care unit said the debate over the nation's health-care system is hurting orders for new medical equipment. "The prospect of health-care reform is worse than health care itself," GE's John Dineen said, adding both the recession and potential reform are freezing orders. Matthew Scalo, an analyst at Canaccord Adams said the comments, along with a "pullback on the habits of hospitals buying large capital equipment" are weighing on Hologic's shares.

ICU Medical Inc.'s (ICUI, $37.86, +$2.07, +5.78%) third-quarter profit fell 17% as revenue declined less than expected, leading the medical-equipment company to again raise its 2009 earnings guidance. The company also narrowed its revenue outlook while maintaining its gross-margin target.

Lexmark International Inc.'s (LXK, $26.16, +$3.59, +15.91%) third-quarter profit slumped 73% on restructuring costs as the printer maker reported core results far better than the company's downbeat forecast on stronger than expected demand.

Marshall & Ilsley Corp. (MI, $6.55, -$0.63, -8.77%) swung to a third-quarter loss amid charges and surging loan-loss provisions. Separately, the largest Wisconsin-based bank said it would offer at least $775 million of stock for sale.

Catalysts for MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS, $6.57, -$0.43, -6.14%) and Leap Wireless International Inc. (LEAP, $13.41, -$0.61, -4.35%) remain mostly negative, with upcoming quarterly reports likely to disappoint on fundamentals, Goldman Sachs said in cutting the two to neutral from buy. The firm noted competition's on the rise.

Millicom International Cellular S.A.'s (MICC, $73.45, -$4.65, -5.95%) investors are particularly disappointed with customer intake at its operations in Senegal, says analyst Stefan Pettersson at Nordea, after the telecom operator reports weaker than expected third-quarter customer intake.

Adecco SA (ADEN.VX) said Tuesday it is acquiring U.S.-based staffing firm MPS Group Inc. (MPS, $13.51, +$2.37, +21.27%) for $1.3 billion in cash, a deal meant to bolster the Swiss firm's professional placement activities.

Nara Bancorp Inc.'s (NARA, $8.00, -$0.97, -10.81%) announced a $70 million common-stock offering. The company said it intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which includes funding working-capital requirements and supporting growth of Nara's banking business.

NCI Building Systems Inc. (NCS, $2.21, -$0.30, -11.95%) completed a $250 million equity investment by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice.

NCI said its board will be reconfigured, and it refinanced its existing term loan.

Nu Skin Enterprises Inc. (NUS, $24.15, +$2.21, +10.07%) hit a 52-week high after it boosted its third-quarter outlook and said it posted record revenue of $334.2 million during the period, up 8% from a year earlier. The direct selling company, which makes skin care products, also boosted its full-year earnings and revenue view.

Parker Hannifin Corp.'s (PH, $57.97, +$2.71, +4.90%) fiscal first-quarter profit slid 71% as orders slumped and revenue fell across all of the hydraulic equipment maker's segments. But the company also raised its full-year target for earnings from continuing operations.

US HOT STOCKS: Pulte, Sherwin-Williams, UAL, UnitedHealth -3-

Precision Castparts Corp. (PCP, $99.11, -$5.61, -5.36%) reported fiscal second-quarter results that fell short of analysts' estimates. The company attributed the weak results to aerospace destocking, economic pressures on the general industrial markets, planned downtime of major forging complexes and seasonal European holidays.

Home builders traded lower as the September housing starts increased less than expected. Pulte Homes Inc. (PHM, $10.08, -$0.53, -5.00%), Lennar Corp. (LEN, $13.98, -$0.41, -2.85%) and Meritage Homes Corp. (MTH, $19.65, -$0.73, -3.58%) were among the largest decliners.

Sherwin-Williams Co.'s (SHW, $59.04, -$4.03, -6.39%) third-quarter profit fell 1.1% as its cost cutting stemmed impacts from continued sales declines. But while it narrowed its 2009 forecast, the company gave a weak projection for this quarter.

SolarWinds Inc.'s (SWI, $20.70, -$2.11, -9.25%) third-quarter profit grew 39% as the network-management software company reported higher revenue, helping it top expectations. The company also raised its full-year target.

State Street Corp.'s (STT, $47.84, -$4.41, -8.44%) third-quarter profit jumped 8.2% on prior-year charges as the money manager recorded gains in the latest period from investment securities. The latest results were slightly better than expected, but the stock still dropped as investors looked at the fact that foreign exchange, securities lending and overdraft were soft, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Brad Hintz said, adding investors were mistaken to do so.

Sunrise Senior Living Inc. (SRZ, $5.54, +$0.23, +4.33%) got a bit more breathing room after announcing late Monday a 13th amendment to it credit agreement extending the maturity date to Dec. 2, 2010. CEO Mark Ordan called the full-year extension an "important step forward" in the company's restructuring.

UAL Corp. (UAUA, $7.90, +$0.64, +8.82%) said its third-quarter loss narrowed significantly on big year-earlier fuel-hedging losses. Results for the parent of United Airlines beat analysts' predictions.

UDR Inc.'s (UDR, $14.56, -$1.07, -6.85%) third-quarter loss widened as the company wrote down its investment in two joint ventures. The apartment operator unprofitable for six-consecutive quarters also lowered its 2009 forecast because of the write-down.

UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s (UNH, $25.96, +$1.04, +4.17%) third-quarter earnings rose a bigger-than-expected 13% as cost controls more than offset commercial enrollment losses and the growth of its lower margin government business.

Shares of biopharmaceutical company United Therapeutics Corp. (UTHR, $41.98, -$2.42, -5.45%) slipped after Actelion posted stronger than expected U.S. sales for its pulmonary arterial hypertension drug Ventavis, making investors jittery about United Therapeutics' newly launched competing treatment, Tyvaso. "Actelion did exceptionally well today in terms of sales, and people are reading into those numbers," Benchmark Co. noted. "The drug of choice isn't clear, but we still think Tyvaso has significant prospects and the company's 2010 earnings are going to be good."

Volterra Semiconductor Corp. (VLTR, $15.01, -$3.39, -18.42%) shares fell after the company's profit fell 36% as revenue slipped 2.9%. The results came in line with the company's raised third-quarter view released last month, but earnings missed Street views.

Wendy's/Arby's Group Inc.'s (WEN, $4.30, -$0.31, -6.72%) stock fell after UBS cut its rating on the shares to neutral from buy, citing weak sales trends for the company's brands. But the firm said it's upbeat on the company's long-term outlook. Bank of America, starting Wendy's/Arby's at neutral, added the company deserves a lower valuation considering its above-average exposure to the weak U.S. market and the lack of a significant international presence. The firm noted, however, that Wendy's/Arby's has improved margins and appears intent on pushing them higher.

Bank holding company Whitney Holding Corp.'s (WTNY, $8.70, -$0.73, -7.74%) third-quarter loss widened, and missed analysts' expectations, as the company set aside 8.8% more for credit losses than it did in the prior quarter. The company also said it will sell $200 million in common stock.

Zions Bancorp Inc. (ZION, $17.23, -$1.10, -6.00%) swung to a third-quarter loss as the company continued to suffer from sour loans, but it noted some signs of stabilization in the economy.
