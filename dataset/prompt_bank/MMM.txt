    (1)    Per $1,000 principal amount of notes validly tendered and not 
           validly withdrawn and accepted for purchase in the applicable offer 
           at or prior to the early tender deadline; included in the 
           applicable total consideration for such series of notes. 
    (2)    Incudes the early tender premium (as defined below) per $1,000 
           principal amount of notes for each series of notes as set forth in 
           this table. 
    (3)    Per $1,000 principal amount of notes validly tendered and not 
           validly withdrawn and accepted for purchase in the applicable offer 
           after the early tender deadline and at or prior to the expiration 
           date; included in the applicable tender consideration for such 
           series of notes. 
 

Subject to the terms and conditions of the offers, holders or beneficial owners ("holders") of notes who validly tendered and did not validly withdraw their notes at or prior to the early tender deadline, and whose notes are accepted for purchase by 3M , are eligible to receive consideration, per $1,000 principal amount, equal to the applicable total consideration for such series of notes. The total consideration has been determined in the manner described in the offer to purchase by reference to the applicable fixed spread for such series of notes set forth in the column entitled "fixed spread" in the table above, over the applicable yield based on the bid side price of the U.S. Treasury Security set forth for such series of notes in the column entitled "reference security" in the table above, as calculated by the dealer manager (as defined below) at 11 a.m., New York City Time, on Oct. 5, 2017. The total consideration includes an early tender premium equal to $50 per $1,000 principal amount of such series of notes accepted for purchase (the "early tender premium"). Subject to the terms and conditions of the offers, holders who validly tender and do not validly withdraw their notes after the early tender deadline and at or prior to the expiration date, and whose notes are accepted for purchase by 3M , are eligible to receive consideration, per $1,000 principal amount, equal to the tender consideration for such series of notes. The tender consideration is equal to the applicable total consideration less the applicable early tender premium for such series of notes.

The withdrawal deadline of 5 p.m., New York City Time, on Oct. 4, 2017, has passed and the notes tendered pursuant to the offers may no longer validly be withdrawn, subject to applicable law.

The offers will expire at midnight, New York City time, at the end of Oct. 19, 2017, unless extended or earlier terminated (such time and date, as the same may be extended with respect to one or more series of notes, the "expiration date").

3M 's obligation to accept for purchase, and to pay for, notes that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the offers is conditioned on the satisfaction or waiver by 3M of a number of conditions. 3M may amend, extend or, subject to certain conditions and applicable law, terminate any or all of the offers at any time in its sole discretion.
