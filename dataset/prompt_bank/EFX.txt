3. What drove the fluctuation in the effective tax rate?

Our effective income tax rate was 26.1% and 29.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, respectively. The decrease in our effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to the adoption of the new stock-based compensation guidance we prospectively adopted in the first quarter of 2017 that requires the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. These amounts were previously recognized in additional paid-in-capital. We recognized a $4.8 million tax benefit related to the accounting change in the third quarter of 2017.

4. What is the breakdown of costs related to the cybersecurity incident?

During the third quarter of 2017, we recorded $87.5 million ($59.3 million, net of tax) for expenses related to the cybersecurity incident announced September 7, 2017. The components of the costs are as follows: 


 
                     Three Months Ended 
(In millions)         September 30, 2017 
Product cost         $                55.5 
Professional fees    17.1 
Consumer support     14.9 
Total                $                 87.5 
 

Expenses Incurred. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company recorded $27.3 million of pretax expenses related to the cybersecurity incident. These expenses are included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017. Expenses include costs to investigate and remediate the cybersecurity incident and legal and other professional services related thereto, all of which were expensed as incurred.

Contingent Liability. Additionally, as a result of the cybersecurity incident, we are offering free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection to all U.S. consumers. We have concluded that the costs associated with providing this service are a contingent liability that is probable and estimable. We have therefore recorded an estimate of the expenses necessary to provide this service to those who have signed up or will sign up by the January 31, 2018 deadline. We have incurred $4.7 million through September 30, 2017 and have estimated a range of additional costs between $56 million and $110 million. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification section 450-20-30-1, we have recorded a liability for the low end in the range as we do not believe that any amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.

(1) During the third quarter of 2017, we recorded acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $43.0 million ($35.1 million, net of tax). We calculate this financial measure by excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and including a benefit to reflect the significant cash income tax savings resulting from the income tax deductibility of amortization for certain acquired intangibles. The $7.9 million of tax is comprised of $14.1 million of tax expense net of $6.2 million of a cash income tax benefit. During the third quarter of 2016, we recorded acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $47.5 million ($38.0 million, net of tax). The $9.5 million of tax is comprised of $15.7 million of tax expense net of $6.2 million of a cash income tax benefit.

(2) During the third quarter of 2016, we recorded $6.3 million ($4.4 million, net of tax) for Veda acquisition related amounts other than acquisition-related amortization related to transaction and integration costs in operating income. See the Notes to this reconciliation for additional detail.

(3) During the third quarter of 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $4.8 million related to the tax effects of deductions for stock compensation in excess of amounts recorded for compensation costs. See the Notes to this reconciliation for additional detail.

(4) During the third quarter of 2017, we recorded $87.5 million ($59.3 million, net of tax) for expenses related to the cybersecurity incident. See the Notes to this reconciliation for additional detail.

During the third quarter of 2016 we recorded the tax impact of adjustments of $11.4 million comprised of (i) acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $9.5 million ($15.7 million of tax expense net of $6.2 million of cash income tax benefit), and (ii) a tax adjustment of $1.9 million for Veda acquisition related amounts other than acquisition related amortization.

Notes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Comparable GAAP Financial Measures

Diluted EPS attributable to Equifax is adjusted for the following items:

Acquisition-related amortization expense - We calculate this financial measure by excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and including a benefit to reflect the material cash income tax savings resulting from the income tax deductibility of amortization for certain acquired intangibles. These financial measures are not prepared in conformity with GAAP. Management believes excluding the impact of amortization expense is useful because excluding acquisition-related amortization, and other items that are not comparable, allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Certain acquired intangibles result in material cash income tax savings which are not reflected in earnings. Management believes that including a benefit to reflect the cash income tax savings is useful as it allows investors to better value Equifax . Management makes these adjustments to earnings when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital.

Veda acquisition related amounts for transaction and due diligence expenses incurred as a direct result of the acquisition, as well as integration expense in the first year following the closure of the acquisition - During the third quarter of 2017, we did not exclude any amounts related to the Veda acquisition transaction charges. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Management makes these adjustments to net income when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax 's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Income tax effects of stock awards that are recognized upon vesting or settlement - During the third quarter of 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $4.8 million related to the tax effects of deductions in excess of compensation costs in accordance with newly adopted guidance. Management believes excluding this tax effect from financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, because this amount is non-operating and relates to income tax benefits or deficiencies for stock awards recognized when tax amounts differ from recognized stock compensation cost. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax 's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Accrual for costs related to the cybersecurity incident - During the third quarter of 2017, we reported that we were the target of a cybersecurity incident impacting approximately 145.5 million U.S. consumers. We recorded $87.5 million ($59.3 million, net of tax) during the third quarter of 2017 associated with the costs to investigate the cybersecurity incident, legal fees to respond to subsequent litigation and costs to deliver the free product offering made to all U.S. consumers. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Management makes these adjustments to net income when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax 's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin - Management defines adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income attributable to Equifax plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and also excludes certain one-time items. Management believes the use of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis.
