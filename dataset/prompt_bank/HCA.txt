1323 ET - HCA Healthcare CEO R Milton Johnson tells analysts "nothing could have prepared us" for the "unprecedented" string of disasters that struck Texas, Florida and Nevada in 3Q. Hurricanes struck Texas in Corpus Christi and Houston, where HCA operates 16 hospitals, and Florida, one of the company's largest markets with 50 hospitals. Storm-related expenses and revenue losses lowered the company's 3Q earnings per share by 24 cents, HCA said. Performance so far this quarter in Houston and Miami point to recovery from the storms, Samuel Hazen , HCA's COO told analysts. "The indications, coming out of the gate in the fourth quarter, given the significance of the events in those markets, does not suggest any permanent issues that would be a result of the hurricanes." Shares slip 1.4%. (melanie.evans@wsj.com)

1322 ET - Kellogg is transitioning away from delivering its snacks directly to stores, and is sending them to retailers' warehouses instead. That hurts sales, as Kellogg doesn't have representatives in stores to promote its brands, and it's doing fewer displays and removing some low-selling products from shelves. But, outgoing Chief John Bryant says the transition reduces Kellogg's overhead costs by cutting its workforce and eliminating warehouse leases. It also has pleased retailers, he says, because now Kellogg's snacks go through their warehouses, making things more efficient, transferring work to the retailers, and giving retailers a higher profit margin.

1310 ET - Leaders in the aerospace and defense sector still oppose the nomination of former Rep. Scott Garrett to head the US Export-Import Bank , even after testimony released Tuesday included a pledge from him to support its future operations. The Aerospace Industries Association has campaigned against the nomination of Garrett, who's twice voted to shut down the bank, a big backer of overseas sales for companies ranging from Boeing and General Electric to SpaceX . "Nothing has changed regarding our attitude towards him," a spokesman for the aerospace industry's main trade group says. (doug.cameron@wsj.com; @dougcameron)

1309 ET - The FTSE 100 index closes up 0.7% at 7493.08, tracking gains in European stocks as political tension between Spain and Catalonia eases, helped by a 1.71% gain in heavyweight oil company BP PLC after strong 3Q results. Positive sentiment offsets the impact of a stronger pound before an expected Bank of England rate rise Thursday. However, the FTSE 100 closes below the 7500 level and underperforms European stocks, with the STOXX Europe 600 index up 0.33%. Croda International jumps 4.24% after backing full-year guidance. easyJet gains 3.16% after strong Ryanair earnings. Miners fall, however, with Fresnillo down 2.6% and Glencore down 2.23%.

1305 ET - US oil production fells to 9.20M bpd in August from 9.23M in July, the EIA says. The monthly August number is in line with EIA projections for production to have averaged 9.22M bpd in 3Q, and it's 6% higher than August 2016 output of 8.7M. But the month-on-month decline raises further doubts as to whether output will surge in 4Q to average 9.6M bpd, as the EIA is forecasting. US oil production has been kept in check lately by low oil prices near $50 as producers hold off on bringing wells to the production stage. Rising costs of oilfield services relative to oil prices has also played a key role. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

1300 ET - Nordic markets close mixed with Sweden's OMXS30 index ending the day 0.6% higher, the pan-Nordic OMXN40 index up 0.1% while Oslo's oil-heavy OBX index slid 0.4%. Trading was rather muted on the final trading day of the month, as markets took a breather ahead of some key events later this week, including earnings from Apple and Facebook , the U.S. monthly jobs report and updates from the Federal Reserve and Bank of England . In oil, a bull/bear fight at $61 on Brent crude has extended into a second day, Saxo Bank said. "This...has become a line in the sand and the result of this battle is likely to determine the short-term direction of oil." (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)

1300 ET - Qualcomm falls after WSJ reported Monday reported that Apple, which uses Qualcomm communications chips in a portion of recent iPhones, is working to find alternatives with an eye toward eliminating Qualcomm components from its next-generation devices. That puts at risk the $2.1B, or 13% of Qualcomm 's total chip revenue, that Apple is likely to spend on its chips this year, according to an estimate by Macquarie Capital. The two companies are embroiled in a bitter dispute over patent royalties Qualcomm charges for use of its patents, which handset makers pay whether or not they use Qualcomm 's silicon. Apple alleges that Qualcomm uses its dominant position in chips to charge exorbitant royalties. Qualcomm asserts that its technology has enabled Apple and others to build lucrative businesses and that licensees enter into their agreements voluntarily. QCOM stumbles 7.4% to $50.60.

1253 ET - As buyout speculation lifted Dunkin Brands 8% Monday, analysts began asking: Why now? The purported buyer, JAB Holdings , which also owns Peet's Coffee, Krispy Kreme and Panera, among others, has already absorbed about $700M in debt from its recent acquisitions. If the privately held group were to buy Dunkin, it would include $3B of debt--four times the amount of all of its recent coffee deals combined, Mizuho says. William Blair points out that rumors involving a JAB/Dunkin deal have been circulating for two years, at times when Dunkin stock was much less expensive than it is today. And if JAB were to gobble up Dunkin, what would it do with the Baskin-Robbins ice-cream business, which doesn't seem to fit with JAB's portfolio of breakfast-related companies? "While we would never say never, we do not see any new revelations in Dunkin's business model to date that would render JAB more interested today than at any other point over the past few years," William Blair argues.

1246 ET - While Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the election moved into a higher gear this week, investors mostly shrugged off the developments. Investors say their trades over the last two days have been largely based on companies' 3Q profit reports, with some weak results crimping markets on Monday and a stronger batch sending indexes higher Tuesday. "Whether it's charges filled by Mueller or the next tweet sent out [by President Trump], I don't think it's going to affect markets," says Jon Mackay, investment strategist of Schroders . Paul Karrlsson-Willis , head of global equity sales and trading at Cabrera Capital , adds that investors who reacted to headlines have been burned before, as they watched stocks like Amazon subsequently rise higher. "People are nervous about where the market is today, but they can't get out because they'll worry about underperforming," Karrlsson-Willis says. Some money managers say the big political news this week for markets is the naming of the next Fed chairman. (michael.wursthorn@wsj.com; @4BetterOrWurst)

1232 ET - For years, breakfast-cereal sales have been hurting in the US, and Kellogg has maintained optimism about the business, saying it will return to growth. Despite sales declines persisting in the latest quarter, Kellogg's head of North America Paul Norman says Kellogg is trying to appeal to the healthy-eating trends with brands like Special K, adding cereals with probiotics and other attributes. Meanwhile, it's focused on fun flavors and more convenient ways to eat cereal with some of its kid-centered brands, like its new Cinnamon Frosted Flakes. "We do need to still bring transformational innovation to cereal and to the breakfast occasion," Norman says, adding that people will see more of that in coming months. Kellogg's new CEO Steve Cahillane is also coming in with rose-colored glassed. "Across the globe, I see more opportunities than I do challenges," he says. "I think the pessimism around this category in US food is overdone." (annie.gasparro@wsj.com)

1232 ET - Moody's has a generally upbeat view on the UK property market. Colin Ellis, EMEA chief credit officer at Moody's Investors Service, says the credit rating agency hasn't seen a substantial negative impact from Brexit and that there may be "a little bit of unexpected resilience," ahead of us. Still, there is some downside risk, Ellis says. Moody's has maintained its stable outlook for the prime property market, since borrowers in this sub-sector are less affected by the rise in inflation, according to Annabel Schaafsma, senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service.
