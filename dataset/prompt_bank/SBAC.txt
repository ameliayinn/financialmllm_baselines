1131 ET - The shareholder push for shale discipline in spending and a greater focus on returns and free cash flow appears to be working, leading a number of companies to make changes and setting the stage for more in the weeks to come, according to Tudor Pickering Holt. Investors have fled the oil and gas sector after repeatedly losing money during an era of lower prices in the last three years, but they have signaled that they would come back to the sector if company leaders promised to hold back spending and put return on capital first, Tudor Pickering said.

1128 ET - The success rate for hostile bids is pretty paltry, with more than 60% of them failing, according to data provider Dealogic. Broadcom 's hostile approach to Qualcomm seems especially difficult. For one, the size of the offer, at more than $100B, could be an issue. "It should be noted how difficult it has been over recent years to succeed at hostile transactions and none have been remotely close to the size and scope of this one," writes FBN Securities . "In our view, this would be a complicated deal to complete even on a friendly basis," the note says. In addition to regular-way hostile hurdles, Qualcomm last year struck a deal for NXP that it is trying to close, which could make it that much harder for Broadcom to disrupt. Qualcomm shares are up 1.5%; Qualcomm slips 0.4%. (dana.mattioli@wsj.com; @DanaMattioli)

1120 ET - Combining Sprint and T-Mobile might not have raised wireless service rates, but it would have kept them from falling as quickly, according to Moody's Investors Service . The bond-rating firm warns "prices could take another leg down" as both companies try to fight off market leaders AT&T and Verizon --good news for consumers, less so for investors. Moody's expects each company to counter that trend with differentiation, with AT&T bundling video and wireless and Verizon focusing on 5G networks. "T-Mobile is likely to continue its successful strategy that focuses on balancing value, simplicity and continually improving service quality," Moody's adds, while "Sprint looks poised to pursue MVNO partnerships with the cable industry," its recent deal with Altice being an example.

1112 ET - A study raising questions about certain uses of coronary stents could cause a decline in implantation procedures, but Wells Fargo expects it will be modest and have a small financial impact on manufacturers. The study, "Orbita," concluded that stents implanted in patients to alleviate chest pain didn't significantly improve exercise time in patients versus those getting a sham procedure. Wells Fargo sees less than a 5% reduction in US stent procedures over the next year as a result of the study, which would cut sales by less than 1% for major manufacturers Abbott Labs , Boston Scientific and Medtronic , relative to each company's total sales.

10:47ET - Oil's rally to $56/bbl comes at a much-needed time for OPEC-member Venezuela, whose finances are in disarray after US sanctions and opposition pressure successfully blocked it from issuing new government debt to pay off old debt. But Risa Grais-Targow at Eurasia Group tells WSJ higher oil prices won't fix much for struggling President Maduro. She says Venezuela's already-falling oil production, about 1.9M bpd, may accelerate lower into 2018 amid weakening internal support, thus offsetting potential revenue-bumps from higher prices. Venezuela announced it will restructure its debt after it tried to issue a new, $3.5B-$5B bond that was "vetoed by Donald Trump at the behest of [opposition legislator] Julio Borges ," Maduro said.

1030 ET - On Deck Capital shares fall 3% after the online lender reported weaker-than-expected 3Q results. On Deck lost $4.5M, or 6 cents per share, in 3Q, while analysts were looking for a profit of 2 cents per share.

On Deck said it expected to report a GAAP profit in the fourth quarter. (peter.rudegeair@wsj.com; @rudegeair)

1018 ET - Third-party sales have become more dominant on Amazon. Those merchants are expected to account for roughly 70% of the estimated $340.71B of merchandise bought on Amazon this year, according to FactSet forecasts. That's a problem for some brands and manufacturers, who are having more trouble controlling distribution and supply chain thanks to the trend. (laura.stevens@wsj.com; @laurastevenswsj)

1012 ET - Amazon is choosing to lower the price on some third-party sellers' goods, a move that could further strain Amazon's complicated relationship with big-name brands, manufacturers and its merchants. While it may increase sellers' sales in some cases, it could also cause them to violate a wholesalers' minimum advertised price or its contracts with other marketplaces. Amazon bears the cost.
