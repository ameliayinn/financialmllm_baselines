Indianapolis Power & Light Company (IPL), a subsidiary of The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES), filed its regulatory rate review today with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) to cover the cost of replacing older, outdated coal plants with one of the cleanest, most efficient natural gas plants ever to be built in Indiana. If IPL's request is approved by the IURC, new rates are expected to be effective by the end of 2018.

"At IPL, we have a responsibility to find the balance between cleaner energy solutions and affordability while maintaining reliability that our customers expect," said Rafael Sanchez, IPL President and CEO. "Our investments in advanced technology have enabled us to significantly reduce our dependence on coal and transition to a more balanced energy mix all while maintaining one of the lowest rates among investor-owned utilities in Indiana."

If approved, IPL's request would result in the typical residential customer, one using 1,000 kWh per month, seeing an increase of a little less than $14 per month. Customers can plan for a potential impact on their bills by utilizing our rate calculator on IPLpower.com/answers. The proposed rate increase will vary among business customers depending on rate class and usage.

Minimizing the impact on customers' bills is a priority for IPL, which is why we provide easy and convenient billing and payment options, including: 


   -- Budget Billing allows customers to pay about the same amount for 11 
      months and then settle the difference on the 12th month. 
 
   -- Preferred Billing Date is offered for IPL customers who want a due date 
      that best matches their paydays. This is especially useful for fixed 
      income customers. 
 
   -- Payment Extensions can be requested online at IPLpower.com or by calling 
      our automated system at 317.261.8222 and selecting option 2 from the main 
      menu. 
 
   -- Financial Assistance is available by calling the Connect2Help line at 
      2-1-1. 

IPL also offers energy-efficient programs, like IPL PowerView, that provide easy ways to reduce energy and ultimately allows our customers to be in control of their monthly bills.
