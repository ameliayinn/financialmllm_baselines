The reason? Executives at the Bethesda, Md., hotel company figure the economy's gains are likely to last until the renovations are done -- and Host can reap the benefits.

Large companies across the U.S. are gearing up to improve tactical radio systems, expand distribution centers, produce more crackers and refurbish hotel rooms -- all signs of increased business investment that could give another boost to the strengthening U.S. economy.

The big spenders range from department-store chain Macy's Inc. to Campbell Soup Co. and defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp. All told, capital investment rose 15% in the fourth quarter to a five-year high of $166 billion, according to an analysis of capital-spending figures for 423 large companies from financial-data firm Calcbench -- the third-fastest rise since early 2010.

Capital investment includes spending that improves or extends the life of physical assets like buildings, equipment and computers. Companies are under pressure to do more of it as aging business models and equipment run into limits on their growth and need to be updated. The improving economy is also starting to reward such investment.

"In terms of all the fundamentals, it looks pretty good still, so why wait?" said Gee Lingberg, a vice president at Host Hotels, which plans to boost nonroutine capital investment to as much as $260 million in 2015 from $112 million last year. "Now that the economy is getting stronger, even with a slight uptick in supply, demand should be able to exceed that."

Energy companies are slashing spending plans as oil prices fall, but other companies are helping pick up the slack. The U.S. Commerce Department on Friday said business investment across the broader economy posted solid gains in the fourth quarter.

The gains follow a long stretch of lackluster business investment. In fact, the fourth-quarter increase noted by Calcbench only slightly outpaced gains in revenue. Economists like Ted Wieseman at Morgan Stanley are heartened but want to see a pattern take hold.

"It's been a dismal period for capital growth," Mr. Wieseman said. "It's encouraging to see some pickup, but for it to really turn around you'd need to see a consistent increase for several years."

Campbell said it expects to increase capital spending by about 15% to $400 million during the year ending this summer. About 40% of that will pay for maintaining and replacing existing equipment. Much of the rest will go to a combination of cost-saving efforts and production expansion -- adding capacity in its Pepperidge Farm cracker and Bolthouse Farms salad-dressing lines, for example. The company is also investing in productivity improvements, including its "soup common platform initiative" to simplify packaging and other aspects of making the company's iconic soups, including cutting back from a dozen or more sizes of carrot and potato chunks to just three each.

Harris Corp., which specializes in communications technology for the military and police, said it has increased its research-and-development spending -- excluding government-funded efforts -- to 5.3% of revenue from 4% in the year that ended in June 2012. A significant part of that is going into the company's high-return business making tactical and encrypted radios for the U.S. military and allied governments.

"We see the U.S. budgets bottoming and procurement activity picking up as the Army modernizes," Chief Executive William Brown told investors and analysts at a conference in mid-February, adding that the company also plans to expand hiring.

Some retailers are also planning big pushes. Macy's said it would raise capital spending by $100 million this year, as it tries to develop a bargain-store format and works to tie its online and physical stores together more closely.

Budget retailer Dollar Tree Inc. said it expects to ramp up capital expenditures by as much as 45% over last year's levels, to between $465 million and $475 million. Much of that will go toward opening a new distribution center in the Southeast, as well as adding new stores and remodeling old ones, including the addition of freezer or refrigerator capacity at 320 stores, the company said.

"As part of the growth phase of our business, we need to make sure we have the distribution facilities . . . to accommodate future growth," investor relations Vice President Randy Guiler said.

There are always some companies spending while others retrench. But the samplings indicate spending may pick up after a relatively strong showing last year. Among 358 large companies that have reported year-end results, capital expenditures rose by 9% during 2014, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. That outpaces 2013's meager 2% increase and nearly matches 10% growth in 2012.

Total U.S. business investment isn't quite that strong. In the fourth quarter, it rose at a 4.8% rate, slower than in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday. But the full year's investment in equipment, buildings and intellectual property rose faster than during 2013.

Corporate and government figures differ, in part because companies report spending globally, not just in the U.S. Campbell is increasing biscuit capacity in Indonesia, for example, and Host Hotels is adding rooms and redoing bathrooms at a property in Chile.

For many companies, a big chunk of capital spending goes to routine repairs and replacement necessary to maintain existing profits. At Host Hotels, that was $324 million last year, spent on replacing worn carpets and routine updates to older rooms, and is expected to rise only a little this year, to at most $350 million. "That is the cost of doing business," Ms. Lingberg said. "With the occupancies we've been having, you need to update those rooms."

By contrast, the company's current spending push focuses on projects designed to generate higher returns over time. Projects on the company's agenda this year include a new $106 million, 180,000-square-foot conference center in San Diego, on the drawing board for more than two years; a $33 million complete renovation of the Powell Hotel in San Francisco; and a $28 million conversion of the Four Seasons Philadelphia into an independent luxury hotel.

"It's not like this is the best time to do it, because occupancy is high," Ms. Lingberg said. Still, "we think the supply-and-demand horizon is still good for the next couple of years."

Defense contractor Northrop said it boosted capital expenditures by 50% last year as it consolidated facilities. "And we anticipate them being higher this year and for a few years in the future," corporate Vice President Stephen Movius told analysts and investors in a Feb. 19 conference presentation.

Spending at particular companies doesn't always constitute evidence of a trend. Hardware and rural lifestyle chain Tractor Supply Co., for example, is projecting capital spending of $250 million to $280 million this year -- well above the $160 million spent in 2014 -- much of it devoted to opening new stores and adding distribution center capacity. But that is largely because 2014 spending was unexpectedly low, thanks to a delayed distribution center, a few under-budget projects and some behind-schedule information technology initiatives, Chief Financial Officer Anthony Crudele said.

And capital spending plans can change. The energy industry is the starkest example of that. After oil prices went over a cliff last fall, spending followed. Going into 2015, projected capital-expenditure cuts range from 15% for integrated oil companies to 35% for natural-gas exploration and production firms -- and overall, the energy industry plans to cut spending by $100 billion this year, said Paul Sankey, energy analyst with Wolfe Research. Oil-and-gas producer Chesapeake Energy Corp., for example, said it would reduce capital expenditures by 37%.

Still, as dramatic as the energy-sector cuts are, mining equipment -- including oil rigs -- makes up only about 7% of business investment and about 1% of the U.S. economy, said Paul Ashworth, chief North American economist for Capital Economics.
