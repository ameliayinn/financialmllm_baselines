NEW YORK, June 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of Citizens Financial Group, Inc. securities (NYSE: CFG) from March 18, 2016 through March 29, 2017, inclusive (the "Class Period") of the important June 26, 2017 lead plaintiff deadline. The lawsuit seeks to recover damages for Citizens investors under the federal securities laws.

To join the Citizens class action, go to http://rosenlegal.com/cases-1106.html or call Phillip Kim, Esq. or Kevin Chan, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or kchan@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.

NO CLASS HAS YET BEEN CERTIFIED IN THE ABOVE ACTION. UNTIL A CLASS IS CERTIFIED, YOU ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL UNLESS YOU RETAIN ONE. YOU MAY ALSO REMAIN AN ABSENT CLASS MEMBER AND DO NOTHING AT THIS POINT. YOU MAY RETAIN COUNSEL OF YOUR CHOICE.

The complaint alleges that defendants during the Class Period made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Citizens employees were falsifying information related to the Citizens Checkup program; (2) in turn, Citizens' reported Citizens Checkup figures were inflated; and (3) as a result, defendants' statements about Citizens' business, operations, and prospects were false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On March 29, 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that certain Citizens employees admitted that Citizens employees faked "financial checkup" meetings with customers. On this news, shares of Citizens declined, damaging investors.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than June 26, 2017. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
