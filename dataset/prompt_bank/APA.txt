1713 ET - The cost of self-driving vehicle technology will drop 90% by 2025 thanks to greater volumes and product innovations, the CEO of components supplier Delphi says. "It's got to get down to $5,000-$6,000 for consumer acceptance," Kevin Clark tells WSJ. State-of-the-art autonomous driving systems costs upwards of $80,000 today, but that will decline rapidly due to scale economies and advancements in key technologies such as solid state light detection sensor, or Lidar, modules, he says. Delphi, which is changing its name to Aptiv Tuesday, has said it expects to start commercializing self-driving vehicle systems by 2019. (chester.dawson@wsj.com; @DecodeTheFirm)

1708 ET - Canada is working on contingency plans in the event of Nafta's demise that aim to limit any negative fallout by as much as possible, the country's chief Nafta negotiator tells Canadian lawmakers. "We have a number of ideas in that regard," Steve Verheul tells the parliamentary trade committee, without elaborating. Verheul adds Canada is also contemplating what to do in the event the Trump administration commences the formal 6-month process under which the US can withdraw from Nafta. He says Canada expects a fairly robust reaction from US industry, and it's likely Canada would work "very closely" with US stakeholders to try to persuade Trump from following through on the threat to withdraw at the end of the 6-month process.

1704 ET - Loblaw, Canada's biggest grocer and retailer, says its Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacy unit will distribute medical marijuana supplied by Aphria, the country's second-biggest cannabis producer. The tie-up is Loblaw's first supplier announcement in the medical-marijuana space following reports it applied for a distribution license last year. It is expected Aphria's products will be sold online, as Canadian regulations currently restrict the sale of medical cannabis in retail pharmacies, the company says. Canada is expected to legalize marijuana by July, leading to a flurry of deals announced by the country's publicly-listed cannabis companies. The medicinal deal may also serve as a potential first step for Loblaws to consider selling marijuana in some Canadian provinces that will allow private businesses to sell the legalized cannabis.

1644 ET - Canada's chief Nafta negotiator, Steve Verheul , says his team is struggling to come up with proposals or ideas that can address complaints from the Trump administration over the trade pact. "We can bring some creativity to the table to developing outcomes that could be categorized as a US win," he tells members of parliamentary trade committee, citing areas such as autos, the sunset clause and dispute settlement. The issue, he says, is the US's overarching objective is to reduce the benefits enjoyed by Canada and Mexico under Nafta, and ensure they are enjoyed solely by the US. "The only way the negotiations can succeed is if it's win-win-win and all three parties benefit," he says. What the US is looking to do is a "recipe for making North America less competitive."

1619 ET - Canada's chief negotiator at Nafta, Steve Verheul , told Canadian lawmakers the Trump administration's proposal on auto-sector content is "wholly unworkable," and warned Canada wouldn't sign on to a continental trade pact that "fundamentally weaken the benefits of Nafta for Canada." Verheul, in a rare public appearance before a parliamentary trade committee, said US proposals dealing with autos, the dispute-settlement process, government procurement, and a sunset clause are "extreme," echoing language used by senior Canadian officials such as Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland . He added the US is also proposing the elimination of Canadian tariffs on dairy, poultry and eggs with no assurances the US will do likewise for Canadian agrifood products. His hardline comments come as Nafta talks are at a standstill. The next full round of talks is scheduled for Montreal in late January. (paul.vieira@wsj.com, @paulvieira)

1612 ET - Farmers and ranchers will benefit from President Trump's move to slash the size of national monuments in Utah, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation . The group says the decision helps unwind the Obama administration's abusive "quarantine" of millions of acres of grazing land, according to AFBF President Zippy Duvall, who says rural Americans suffered under a "remote bureaucracy." Duvall sees Trump's move in keeping with the original spirit of the 1906 Antiquities Act and follows similar reductions by past presidents like Taft and Kennedy. (jacob.bunge@wsj.com; @jacobbunge)

1554 ET - Barclays thinks some of the packaged food industry's problems this year may be imaginary. The challenge that seems to worry investors most is the pressure from retailers to lower prices, "however, while price pressure may yet come, the data thus far simply do not bear out this concern." Among the largest packaged food categories, about two-thirds have higher prices than a year ago, and the percentage of items sold at a discount decreased, according to Barclays analysis of Nielsen data. Barclays says margins have decreased but that's due to higher freight costs, food prices and customer service costs. Pricing pressure isn't the "culprit." (annie.gasparro@wsj.com)

1520 ET - US air-safety regulators seek to mandate enhanced pre-flight checks of 3,200 twin-engine Boeing jets before each extended overwater flight, aiming to ensure that fuel-line valves don't malfunction during such trips. Combined with an engine shutdown, a failed valve can result in fuel starvation. Under the FAA 's proposed rule, airlines will have 120 days to change pre-flight procedures or minimum requirements for functioning equipment on 737s, 757s, 767s, 777s and 787s. The aims is to guarantee that if a valve stops working in the closed position--which the agency said can remain undiscovered for several flights--it won't block fuel in certain tanks from flowing to the remaining operating engine.

1505 ET - Federal tax reform legislation could boost earnings for industrial conglomerates and distributors of industrial supplies by an average of 11% in 2019, says RBC Capital Markets . The earnings gain would primarily come from a lower US corporate tax rate and the ability to immediately expense capital investments. Among the biggest profit gainers projected by RBC are distributors W.W. Grainger --up 29%--and HD Supply --up 22%. Companies benefiting the least are those that have moved offshore to tax-friendly havens like Ireland where they're already taxed at reduced rates. RBC estimates that corporate expats Eaton, Ingersoll-Rand and Pentair would each gain less than 5%, mostly from expensing capex. Grainger up 4.5% at $228.19. Eaton, Ingersoll and Pentair trading slightly lower. (robert.tita@wsj.com; @bob_tita)
