Of the top 20 global employers in 2017, five are outsourcing and "workforce solutions" companies, according to an analysis by S&P Global Market Intelligence. In 2000, only one employer in the top 20 -- International Business Machines Corp., which offers outsourced information-technolgy services among its many businesses -- fell into that bucket.

Outsourcing companies are vacuuming up the world's workers as traditional employers are handing over more of their tasks to nonemployees, a shift that has transformed the way corporations do business and profoundly affected workers' prospects and pay.

The past two decades have been boom times for the outsourcing sector, with the annual value of contracts growing to $37 billion in 2016 from $12.5 billion in 2000, according to research and advisory firm Information Services Group Inc. The market is expected show growth again in 2017 and 2018, thanks partly to a double-digit increase in big technology projects as more companies transfer massive volumes of data to the cloud.

For employers, dispatching work to outside companies saves money and lets them access skills they need without adding to their head count. Workers in jobs that have gone to outsourcers, though, can feel moved around like chess pieces, either displaced entirely or re-badged as employees of a service provider, sometimes with fewer benefits and lower pay. A growing body of economic research suggests that outsourcing is a significant factor fueling the rise of income inequality in the past decade.

"If all the engineers are in one firm and the cleaners are in another, you get less diversity within firms and more inequality across firms," says Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University.

Dublin-based Accenture, best known as an IT and consulting firm, has become the de facto back office for hundreds of client companies. The firm employs 435,000 people globally -- up from some 200,000 in 2010 -- and serves 95 of the Fortune Global 100 with consulting or outsourcing services or both. Outsourcing made up 46% of the company's 2017 revenue, or $16.1 billion, up from 41% in 2011.

On behalf of loan-servicing companies, Accenture's people collect debts from homeowners who defaulted on their mortgages. For large insurance clients, doctors and nurses employed by Accenture make wellness calls to diabetes patients. For Alphabet Inc.'s Google, it oversees contractors who review content for the search giant.

"We become part of our clients' operations; we become part of the talent that's in their operations," says Debbie Polishook, group chief executive of Accenture Operations, which houses the company's outsourcing work.

Companies say that unloading tasks to outside firms allows employees to do more high-value jobs. Providers like Accenture tell companies they can do their work better and more cheaply, prodding executives to view labor as an on-demand resource they can rent as needed.

The breadth of services on offer from outsourcing firms is staggering. Compass Group was founded in 1941 to run factory cafeterias in wartime England, eventually branching out into corporate catering. It now employs more than 550,000 and counts among its subsidiaries firms like Eurest Services, which staffs and manages mailrooms for clients, provides them with full-time receptionists, sets up their conference rooms for meetings and operates their warehouses. Eurest's clients include Google, SAP SE and Pfizer Inc.
