11:44 EDT - Can patients with mild Alzheimer's disease who started on Eli Lilly's (LLY) experimental drug solanezumab later than other patients "catch up" to the earlier starters in improvements in cognition and daily living? That's the key question next month's release of clinical-trial data should answer, David Ricks, head of Lilly's Bio-Medicines unit, tells WSJ in an interview on the sidelines of the Bio International conference in Philadelphia. "If the drug is modifying the disease," the later starters "should never catch up," Ricks says. But if there's no difference versus earlier starters, it could raise questions about whether solanezumab slows the underlying progression of the memory-robbing disease, the Holy Grail of Alzheimer's research. Results are due July 21 at Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Washington. (peter.loftus@wsj.com; @Loftus)

11:42 EDT - The FAA's leader has given a cool reception to a proposal by House Republicans to create a federally chartered nonprofit corporation to run and modernize the US air-traffic-control system. Michael Huerta tells WSJ he isn't supporting such a move because "there are a lot of unanswered questions at this point," particularly around proposed user fees. One major question, he says, is "does the industry broadly support this?" Huerta admits the proposal deserves some attention, but when asked whether it's a good starting point, he responded: "I'm not ready to say that yet." (andy.pasztor@wsj.com)

11:39 EDT - The oil patch isn't quite the gusher it normally is for banks. Global oil-and-gas revenue at investment banks is $2.5B year-to-date, the lowest level since 2010 and 31% off last year's volume, according to Dealogic. A bright spot has been the high demand for depressed E&P stocks, which has made equity capital markets the top offering for banks so far, accounting for $781M in revenue. Debt deals are next, generating $699M of banking revenue. Leading the league tables in oil-and-gas revenue is JPMorgan (JPM), collecting 8.1% of all fees, followed by Bank of America (BAC) and Credit Suisse (CS). (ryan.dezember@wsj.com; @RyanDezember)

11:37 EDT - Rains have drenched some parts of the US in recent weeks and generally come as a welcome change for farmers in many parts of the country worried about dryness. But there's no letup in a severe drought for California, the biggest source of the nation's fruits and vegetables. About 47% of California remains in exceptional drought, the same as the previous week and much higher than the 33% rate in the same week last year, according to the latest US Drought Monitor. Meanwhile, nationwide, exceptional drought has eased to 2.9% from 3.1% both the previous week and the same week a year ago. (ilan.brat@wsj.com; @ilanbrat)

11:35 EDT - Caterpillar's (CAT) monthly retail-sales data should start looking less grim soon because weak year-earlier numbers will set the bar low, notes Jefferies. As such, North America sales may look "flattish for CAT overall for the next 12 months. Bulls may be encouraged by potentially improving optics...but overall (weak) trends appear unlikely to change." Amid this morning's monthly retail-sales report, CAT is slightly higher, trailing the broader market. (bob.hagerty@wsj.com)

11:23 EDT - Natural-gas futures have run to the green twice since the EIA's weekly storage update not quite an hour ago, but a sustained advance remains allusive even as US supplies rose a bit less than expected last week. After a run earlier this week, the small miss isn't enough to justify holding on or buying more, says gas trader John Woods. "They were just expecting more juice from this number." Nymex July is down 0.7% at $2.835/MMBtu. (tim.puko@wsj.com)

11:13 EDT - Israel-based medical-laser firm Lumenis' (LMNS) pending buyout by Chinese investment firm XIO comes as the number of Chinese organizations investing in private Israeli companies is growing at a yearly rate of 50%, according to a new report by IVC Research Center. "The Chinese-Israeli M&A deals we're seeing are coming from equity groups and firms seeking market share and buying mature companies," says Manor Zemer, a broker of Chinese-Israeli technology related deals. "In innovation-driven deals, Chinese investors invest in Israeli-based venture funds and startups." (orr.hirschauge@wsj.com; @orr_hirsch)

11:10 EDT - And is the gun market still on fire? US leader Smith & Wesson (SWHC) reports after the bell, and firearm sales are rebounding faster than even many industry execs expected. Inventories have dropped and sales are starting to lap the tough comps at the tail end of the 2-year boom which petered out last spring. With M&A chatter around Colt and Olin's (OLN) Winchester brand--and Vista Outdoor (VSTO) having the currency for deals--any deviation from the recent upward trend could shoot down the sector's stocks. SWHC is up 1.3% today, putting the year's pop at 69%. (doug.cameron@wsj.com; @dougcameron)

11:08 EDT - Refiners in the U.S. have been able to access a captive source of cheap crude from shale and sell the fuel they produce at higher prices linked to international oil prices. But the spread between U.S.-based West Texas Intermediate crude and Europe's Brent benchmark has narrowed to around $3, and could compress even further if U.S. oil output declines. Still, analysts say that strong fuel demand should buoy refiners' profits, and several have signaled they'll delay taking units offline for maintenance to keep churning out gasoline and diesel. Credit Suisse says that fall maintenance will likely be "average to light." (alison.sider@wsj.com; @alyrose)

11:05 EDT - American Express (AXP), along with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide (HOT) and MasterCard (MA), is learning how to take experimental technology projects from the lab to commercial offerings. American Express recently presented facial recognition technology to senior executives in a project to build new, more secure ways to authenticate customers who want to conduct financial business on their mobile phone. Another project using Google (GOOGL) Glass is on the backburner, waiting for an appropriate business case as well as critical mass to be reached among consumers. (kim.nash@wsj.com)

11:04 EDT - Copper prices have fallen more than 7% this year, but Konkola Copper Mines CEO Steven Din says at an industry conference in Zambia that the sector is still better off than the start of 2015. Then, the government put into effect a new mining-tax regime which more than tripled royalties for open-pit mines. "A lot of good work has been done with this government," says Din. "As the mining industry, we've been involved in a lot of consultation. We're now six months later and in a much-better position." The government announced in April it would roll back the royalty increases, but reinstate incomes taxes, effective July 1. (alexandra.wexler@wsj.com; @alexandrawexler)
