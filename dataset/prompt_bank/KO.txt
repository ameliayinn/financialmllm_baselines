GOODLETTSVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 07, 2017-- 

Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG) today reported financial results for its fiscal 2017 third quarter (13 weeks) ended November 3, 2017.

"We are pleased with our overall third quarter results, which include a strong same-store sales growth of 4.3% and increases in both average transaction amount and customer traffic over the 2016 third quarter. During the quarter, we effectively balanced our same-store sales growth while achieving gross profit rate expansion and continuing our planned investments in the business.

"We remain excited about the future for Dollar General . For fiscal 2018, we have plans to execute approximately 2,000 real estate projects comprised of 900 new stores, 1,000 store remodels and 100 store relocations. We continue to believe that investing in the business through our high-return new store growth is the best use of our capital to help drive long-term shareholder value. Our new store growth is complemented with a significant increase in our store remodel program from fiscal 2017 that we view as an investment to enhance and consistently deliver on our brand promise to help our customers save time and money every day," said Todd Vasos , Dollar General's chief executive officer.

Third Quarter 2017 Highlights

Net sales increased 11.0 percent to $5.90 billion in the 2017 third quarter compared to $5.32 billion in the 2016 third quarter. Same-store sales increased 4.3 percent, attributable to increases in average transaction amount and customer traffic, including an estimated 30 to 35 basis point net benefit from hurricane-related sales. Same-store sales increases were driven by positive results in the consumables, seasonal and apparel categories, partially offset by negative results in the home products category. Same-store sales results in the three non-consumables categories, when aggregated, were positive. The net sales increase was also positively affected by sales from new stores, modestly offset by sales from closed stores.

Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 29.9 percent in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of eight basis points from the 2016 third quarter. The gross profit rate increase was primarily attributable to higher initial inventory markups and an improved rate of inventory shrink. Partially offsetting these items were a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which generally have a lower gross profit rate than other product categories, sales of lower-margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumables sales, and increased transportation costs.

Selling, general and administrative expense ("SG&A") as a percentage of net sales was 22.9 percent in the 2017 third quarter compared to 22.5 percent in the 2016 third quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. The SG&A increase was primarily attributable to increased retail labor expenses, primarily as a result of the Company's investment in store manager compensation, and increased incentive compensation and occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales. Partially offsetting these increased expenses were lower utilities costs and a reduction in advertising costs. During the 2017 third quarter, the Company recorded incremental expenses of approximately $24.8 million, or 42 basis points, related to the impact of two hurricanes which occurred during the quarter as set forth below under "Summary of Impact of Hurricanes on 2017 Third Quarter Results." Similarly, in the 2016 third quarter, the Company incurred incremental charges of $13.0 million, or 25 basis points, associated with the acquisition of former Walmart Express store locations and the related closure of existing stores plus an incremental $7.7 million, or 14 basis points, of expenses primarily related to natural disasters.

The Company's net income was $253 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, in the 2017 third quarter, compared to net income of $235 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, in the 2016 third quarter. An estimated $0.05 hurricane-related net negative impact, driven by hurricane-related expenses, is included in diluted earnings per share for the 2017 third quarter. Similarly, the 2016 third quarter included an approximate $0.05 charge for the Walmart Express store acquisition and disaster-related expenses.

The effective income tax rate was 35.8 percent for the 2017 third quarter compared to a rate of 36.2 percent for the 2016 third quarter. The effective income tax rate was lower in the 2017 third quarter due primarily to the recognition of greater federal Work Opportunity Tax Credits in the 2017 period.

39-Week Period Highlights

For the 39-week period ended November 3, 2017, net sales increased 8.5 percent over the comparable 2016 period to $17.3 billion. Same-store sales increased 2.6 percent, attributable to increases in average transaction amount and customer traffic. When compared to the 2016 39-week period, same-store sales increases were driven by positive results in the consumables, seasonal and apparel categories, partially offset by negative results in the home products category. Same-store sales results in the three non-consumables categories, when aggregated, were positive. The net sales increase was also positively affected by sales from new stores, modestly offset by sales from closed stores.

Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 30.3 percent in the 2017 39-week period, a decrease of 25 basis points from the comparable 2016 period. The gross profit rate decrease in the 2017 period as compared to the 2016 period was primarily attributable to higher markdowns, primarily for promotional activities, a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which generally have a lower gross profit rate than other product categories, and sales of lower margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumables sales. Partially offsetting these items were higher initial inventory markups and an improved rate of inventory shrink.

SG&A was 22.3 percent of net sales in the 2017 39-week period compared to 21.9 percent in the comparable 2016 period, an increase of 43 basis points. The SG&A increase was primarily attributable to increased retail labor expenses, primarily as a result of the Company's investment in store manager compensation, and increased occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales. Partially offsetting these increased expenses were a reduction in advertising costs as well as lower utilities and lower waste management costs primarily resulting from the Company's recycling efforts. As noted above, the 2017 period reflects expenses related to the impact of two hurricanes which occurred during the quarter, and the 2016 period reflects expenses associated with the acquisition of former Walmart Express store locations and related closure of existing stores, plus disaster-related expenses. The Company also recorded incremental expenses, primarily for lease termination costs, related to stores acquired in the second quarter of 2017 from a multi-price point discount retailer.

For the 2017 39-week period, the Company reported net income of $827 million, or $3.02 per diluted share, compared to net income of $837 million, or $2.95 per diluted share, for the 39-week 2016 period. Included in diluted earnings per share for the 2017 39-week period was an approximate $0.01 charge for the early retirement of long-term obligations, an approximate $0.02 charge primarily for the lease termination costs related to the stores acquired in the second quarter of 2017, and an estimated $0.05 hurricane-related net negative impact, driven by hurricane-related expenses. The 2016 39-week period included an approximate $0.04 benefit from the adoption of the share-based payment accounting standard and an approximate $0.05 charge for the Walmart Express store acquisition and disaster-related expenses.

The effective income tax rate for the 2017 39-week period was 36.8 percent compared to a rate of 36.1 percent for the comparable 2016 period. The effective income tax rate was higher in the 2017 39-week period due primarily to the recognition of a tax benefit of approximately $10.9 million in the 2016 period associated with stock based compensation that did not reoccur to the same extent in the 2017 period.

Financial and Store Growth Outlook

For the 52-week fiscal year ending February 2, 2018 ("fiscal 2017"), the Company is updating certain components of its guidance issued on August 31, 2017. The Company's guidance does not contemplate any potential impacts from U.S. corporate tax legislation reform.

The current diluted earnings per share guidance range now includes the estimated net negative impact on the third quarter diluted earnings per share results of $0.05 related to the hurricanes. In addition, the Company now forecasts: 


   -- Fiscal 2017 net sales growth of approximately seven percent, compared to 
      its prior guidance range of five to seven percent growth, 
 
   -- Fiscal 2017 same-store sales growth of approximately 2.5 percent, 
      compared to its prior expectation that same-store sales would fall at the 
      upper end of the range of slightly positive to up two percent, and 
 
   -- Capital Expenditures between $700 million and $750 million, compared to 
      its prior guidance range of $715 million to $765 million. 

Share repurchases for fiscal 2017 continue to be forecasted at approximately $450 million.

For fiscal 2017, the Company continues to plan to open approximately 1,285 new stores, in addition to remodeling or relocating 760 stores.

For the 52-week period ending February 1, 2019, the Company plans to open approximately 900 new stores, remodel approximately 1,000 mature store locations and relocate approximately 100 stores for an approximate total of 2,000 real estate projects.
