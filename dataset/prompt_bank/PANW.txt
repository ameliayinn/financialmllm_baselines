SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 3, 2017

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Palo Alto Networks (R) (NYSE: PANW), the next-generation security company, today announced that its Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) offering, Aperture(TM) SaaS security service, now provides application protections for several Amazon Web Services (AWS) solutions, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

The new protections address sensitive data loss, enable monitoring for risky or suspicious administrator behavior, and provide additional protection against security misconfigurations and malware propagation. When combined with the preventive capabilities of the Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Security Platform, these advancements will enable organizations to achieve even more protection for AWS, as well as address critical cloud security needs to deliver the most complete application and data security for cloud environments. Additionally, Aperture support for Office 365 and Google applications has been enhanced to include cloud-based email services and G Suite Marketplace applications.

Data and applications reside everywhere: on the network, on endpoints, and in the cloud. As part of the migration to the cloud, many enterprises are adopting a multi-cloud strategy that includes storing large amounts of business-critical data within cloud environments, which requires advanced protections that complement basic native cloud offering controls to achieve comprehensive and consistent security.

Palo Alto Networks Aperture controls enterprise SaaS applications and associated data by examining and controlling how data is shared, all without impact to user experience or changes to network infrastructure. If a policy violation occurs, Aperture enables quick enforcement of security policies to quarantine folders and data while immediately alerting security teams of suspicious behavior.
