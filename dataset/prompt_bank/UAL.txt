CHICAGO, Dec. 13, 2017

CHICAGO, Dec. 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- To celebrate United Airlines ' new daily, nonstop service between its Houston hub and Sydney, Australia starting January 18, the airline is searching for individuals across the U.S. -- excluding New York and Florida -- with the first or last name Sydney (see terms and conditions for accepted spelling variations) to enter for a chance to visit the city of their namesake with one guest through a sweepstakes launching today at SydneyHoustonUnited.com.

Five winners and their guests will experience the trip of a lifetime starting with the inaugural flight from Houston to Sydney. Meanwhile, five Australians bearing the first or last name Houston, along with their guests, will be on the return flight on January 20 from Sydney to Houston. In addition to the round-trip flight, each winner and their guest will receive hotel accommodations for five nights at The Westin Sydney, access to local sights and attractions and a $500 prepaid card to customize their trip.

Supporting United's vision to connect people and unite the world, winners will enjoy the quintessential experience of the world-class city they're named after. The "Sydneys" of the U.S. will enjoy a week of epic Sydney-side adventures -- beautiful beaches, big bridges and that 'true blue hospitality' Australians are known for. The "Houstons" from Australia, on the other hand, will swap Bondi BBQ for true Texan style, and their flip flops for cowboy boots.

This new flight will be the only nonstop service to Australia from Houston and offers customers from Houston as well as from hundreds of cities across the U.S. the opportunity to conveniently travel to Sydney. United currently serves Sydney nonstop from its West Coast hubs in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and Melbourne, Australia from Los Angeles.

For complete rules and to enter, visit SydneyHoustonUnited.com. The sweepstakes runs through December 27 and winners will be selected on or around December 28.
