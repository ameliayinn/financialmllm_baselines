On Tuesday, Invitation Homes raised $1.54 billion in its initial public offering, which represents the largest U.S.-listed IPO in more than a year. The real-estate investment trust sold 77 million shares at $20 apiece.

Invitation Homes is the end result of the biggest homebuying spree in history. Starting in 2012 with a home in Phoenix, Blackstone spent some $10 billion buying and fixing up homes to rent. For stretches, the private-equity giant spent $150 million a week on foreclosed homes, often buying them sight unseen.

The company now owns and rents 48,431 houses in 13 markets, from Seattle to south Florida, according to Invitation's offering document. Blackstone Group didn't plan to sell any of its roughly 70% stake in the IPO, the filing said, but the listing will enable it to begin cashing out of its investment in the future.

The IPO is also a test of investors' interest in the rental-home business. Invitation is part of a broader bet on Wall Street that homeownership will remain out of reach for many Americans. Invitation will join its two largest rental-home rivals on the stock market. Shares of American Homes 4 Rent and Colony Starwood Homes made their debuts in recent years to tepid demand but surged last year as the homeownership rate fell to its lowest level in at least 50 years, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.

Homeownership has declined since the housing crisis amid stricter lending standards, mounting student debt and potential buyers whose savings and credit diminished during the recession. But some investors have questioned whether the growth of Invitation and its rivals will be limited now that the foreclosure crisis is over and home prices in many markets have exceeded their 2006 highs.

Last week, Invitation won an important endorsement from Fannie Mae, when the government-controlled mortgage-finance company said it would guarantee as much as $1 billion of the company's debt, a development that will likely mean cheaper borrowing costs for Invitation and potentially its rivals.
