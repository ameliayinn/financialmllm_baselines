1334 ET - The number of active oil rigs in the US rises by one to 737 in the latest week, a slight rebound from a four-month low it reached the prior week. The Baker Hughes data might suggest drillers are encouraged by oil prices that have stayed above $50/bbl for three weeks straight, although analysts say even higher prices are needed for activity to see another strong growth spurt. With today's data, the oil rig count has only risen twice in the past nine weeks. Meanwhile, the number of active natural gas rigs fall by 5 to 172. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

1325 ET - According to a couple of indexes that track billionaires, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has surpassed Bill Gates as the richest man in the world, again, as the online retail giant's stock prices surged after an earnings beat. Still, it's neck-in-neck as Microsoft 's stock prices rise, too, and it remains to be seen who will end the day in the lead. Bezos previously held the title for less than a day in July before Amazon reported earnings. (laura.stevens@wsj.com; @laurastevenswsj)

1321 ET - Automotive supplier Dana is on track to deliver its 2019 earnings plan a year early, thanks to strong demand for Jeep Wrangler SUVs, according to Barclays . Dana will benefit from Fiat Chrysler 's decision to continue production of the current Wrangler model into 2018 even as it ramps up output of a brand new version of its most iconic Jeep , the brokerage says. "Conference calls with both Dana and FCA this week reinforce that there will be at least one quarter of dual [Wrangler model] production (and we think some potential to continue into 2Q'18)," Barclays says. That will help Dana post estimated 2018 revenue of $7.6B and Ebitda of $941M, exceeding Dana's 2019 goals of $7.2B in revenue and Ebitda of $920M, the report says.

1312 ET - Wells Fargo says that now is "NOT the time to throw in the towel," on Mattel , which is off 13.3% to $13.34 after a big 3Q miss, suspension of its dividend and new cost cutting to try to stabilize the company. While noting that 3Q results "appear bad," the firm senses that the period represents "the bottom tip," of what Mattel executives described would be a "U" shaped turnaround that should pick up momentum in 2H 2018. The firm also finds several positives in results, including that retail sales of core brands like Barbie remain strong. Mattel is also getting rid of underperforming and low margin brands, and has a greater management focus on profitability instead of empty sales and a simplified cost structure.

1312 ET - Mall landlords with a nationwide portfolio had an unprecedented 3Q as their shopping centers in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico faced hurricanes and flooding, while their assets in California faced dangers from fires. The Las Vegas mass shooting tragedy also affected tourist visits. "(In) September, we dealt with a lot of crap," says David Simon , CEO of Simon Property , the world's largest REIT and the largest mall operator in the US, in an earnings call. "We've never had malls where we had to shut because of fires." Two of its malls in Puerto Rico remain closed for repairs while other malls have re-opened with regular operating hours. These malls are typically covered by insurance, and ultimately there wasn't a sales decline in the 3Q earnings in part due to the firm's geographic diversity, but Simon also noted that his staff had shown resilience and bravery in the face of tragedy to get these properties back up to serve their communities.

1232 ET - Canada's National Energy Board is reviewing a motion by Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd , challenging the ability of a town in British Columbia to block construction of a Trans Mountain pipeline extension. The NEB "will take the time we need," to review the motion, says a department spokesman in an email to WSJ. Kinder Morgan on Thursday filed a motion with the federal government after failing to obtain municipal permits from the City of Burnaby to construct the pipeline. The NEB and the federal government had already approved expansion of the pipeline in 2016. (vipal.monga@wsj.com; @vipalmonga)

1207 ET - Mixed news for Airbus A320neo operators, with India's IndiGo reporting that all 26 of its jets are flying, but low-cost specialist Spirit Airlines is still only scheduling service with three of its five aircraft because of engine issues. "The latest solution to alleviate the reliability issues has had some success, but it's too early to say this issue is fully resolved," said Spirit CFO Ed Christie on its 3Q call Thursday. Engine maker Pratt & Whitney , a unit of United Technologies , took a $196M charge in 3Q to compensate customers as it funneled more engines to act as spares rather than install on newly-delivered jets.

1154 ET - Among the Trump administration's self-inflicted wounds early after inauguration was its slowness in hiring staff for federal regulatory and other agencies, says Susan Ginsberg , VP of oil and natural gas regulatory affairs at the Washington-based Independent Petroleum Association of America . "I don't know if it was distrust of the federal bureaucracy, or being an outsider in politics and thus simply not putting the pieces in place, but they hit the ground not running," she tells an energy conference audience in Dallas during a Q&A session. She says part of the staffing delays problem was due to an early reluctance by many in DC to be part of the Trump administration, compared with the typically spirited desire to join new presidential administrations. Some, she says, were worried being stamped as "Trump loyalists" could hurt them down the road. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

1142 ET - The good news for Colgate-Palmolive is that currency woes appear to have finally abated. The bad news: despite this, its financial results are weaker. Colgate reports tepid sales growth and a dip in net income, with none of the weakness attributed to currency headwinds. Noted one analyst on the quarterly earnings call: "I don't recall a quarter where we've seen so much operating margin contraction in a favorable FX market." (sharon.terlep@wsj.com)

1114 ET - Department store stocks fall after JC Penney lowers its 3Q guidance. Even though Penney's issues stemmed from a revamp of its women's apparel department, analysts remain cautious on department stores heading into the important holiday shopping season. Jefferies analyst Randal Konik noted in a report to clients that department stores as a group have resorted to higher discounts to lure shoppers in recent weeks, compared with the same period a year ago. "We Remain Hesitant With Mall Based Dept Stores," Konik wrote. "While we acknowledge the positive work JCP is doing to become less apparel reliant (with initiatives like the expansion of home, appliances, beauty, and salon) the sector faces intense secular headwinds as mall traffic wanes and the shift to e-comm should also continue to weigh on profitability." Penney shares drop 15% (suzanne.kapner@wsj.com)

1100 ET - That was quick. Most US defense stocks recover some of Thursday's losses, which analysts had attributed to guides for 2018 sales and cash flow growth that were lighter than expected among many investors who'd driven the sector to recent record highs. L3 Technologies leads the pack, up 2% and wiping out the decline in the previous session. L3 on Thursday morning announced 3Q results and guided sales growth of 4%-5% next year, excluding the impact of the Vertex military maintenance unit now earmarked for sale. Most other prime contractors up today in line with the broader market. (doug.cameron@wsj.com; @dougcameron)
