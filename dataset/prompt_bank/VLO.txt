0907 ET - Ryman Hospitality's 3Q revenue comes in more than 80% below the level in the year-ago period as the REIT logs a quarterly loss of $2.14 a share. Still, the company says it has seen some smaller instances of group travel returning, adding that corporate customers have appeared eager to resume in-person gatherings as public-health conditions allow. Industry analysts have said they expect that as travel recovers from the pandemic, leisure travel will likely return faster than business customers for hotels and airlines. CEO Colin Reed says Ryman is also focused on drawing leisure travelers looking for short-range road trips. At $39.79, Ryman shares are down more than 54% year to date, mirroring declines across the industry. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)

0901 ET - A 'clean sweep' by either Joe Biden or Donald Trump in Tuesday's U.S. election, where one party wins the presidency alongside control of the Senate and the House of Representatives, would be negative for the dollar and positive for equities, Mizuho analysts say. "We would expect a clean sweep by either party to have roughly the same directional impact (risk-on, oil positive, USD negative)," it says. A disputed elections would likely lead to a "mixed/stronger dollar," selloffs acorss equities and oil, credit steepening and bull-flattening in U.S. Treasurys, Mizuho says. The DXY dollar index is last down 0.6% at 93.5910. (jessica.fleetham@wsj.com)

0824 ET - US benchmark oil prices are rising sharply for a second straight session, up 2.7% at $37.80 a barrel as election day begins in the US. "The strong gains that oil enjoys today have nothing to do with real fundamentals, Covid-19 did not go away overnight and there's no hurricane out the window," says Rystad Energy 's Bjornar Tonhaugen. "However Tuesday is not just any day, it's the US election day and the market cannot just leave that out of the equation. Traders need to cover positions ahead of putting the insecurity of an election behind." Adding price-support, he says, are hopes OPEC and Russia will delay raising production given still-weak global demand. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

0820 ET - Drug-pricing reform is likely to take a back seat to efforts to develop coronavirus vaccines and strike a U.S. economic-aid deal after the U.S. election, says SVB Leerink . The pandemic's severity means any new U.S. president will have to focus on developing and distributing vaccines and treatments, as well as passing another stimulus package, the brokerage says. "Thus, even in the case of a Democratic victory in both the White House and the Senate, drug-pricing reform will be a secondary priority after Covid," Leerink analysts say, adding that any clarity on the issue may not emerge until the second half of next year or later. Still, Democrats would be likely to increase federal control of vaccine distribution, they say. (philip.waller@wsj.com)

0814 ET - Global demand for farm equipment should be roughly flat this year compared with 2019, Agco CEO Martin Richenhagen says in prepared remarks. Flat isn't growth, but it is better than the tractor manufacturer's expectation, discussed in June, that demand would be weaker year over year amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Global grain consumption is recovering and "soft commodity prices have risen in the third quarter, which is positive for farm economics," Richenhagen says.

0809 ET - Spirit AeroSystems delivered 15 shipsets for the 737 MAX in 3Q, providing a rough guide to Boeing production since assembly resumed in May. That leaves another 20 for 4Q under its revised Boeing deal, and monthly output was scheduled to rise to 12 at the turn of 2021, though the plane maker has now slowed forecast deliveries of completed jets in 2021. Spirit 's overall shipset volume halved in the quarter, though deliveries to Airbus ran at twice the level of those to Boeing . (doug.cameron@wsj.com; @dougcameron)

0805 ET - A Biden victory would "deal a blow" to oil giants such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron , while creating further opportunities for renewable-infrastructure companies, says Rachel Winter , associate investment director at Killik & Co , a U.K.-based investment house. She says the biggest difference between the candidates is their attitude to fossil fuels and renewables. While Trump is a big supporter of the fossil-fuel industry and praises it for generating revenue and jobs for the U.S., Biden is supportive of the transition to renewable power. One company that would benefit if the democratic candidate wins is NextEra Energy , she says. NextEra is one of the largest utilities in the U.S. and one of the largest generators of electricity from renewable resources. (maitane.sardon@wsj.com)

0801 ET - Sports venues are offering new visitor experiences as the coronavirus pandemic chokes revenue from ticket sales. Stadiums and arenas across the country have hosted events like dinosaur safaris, Halloween drive-throughs and outdoor movie theaters alternatives to claw back revenues lost from spectator-free game days, offering up their large amounts of space to those looking for socially-distanced activities outside of the house. Stadium executives are clear these new experiences will not come close to covering the losses of 2020. They do, however, help keep staff employed, venue bosses said.
