ATLANTA, Oct. 24, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PulteGroup, Inc . (NYSE:PHM) announced today financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2017. For the quarter, the Company's reported net income was $178 million, or $0.58 per share. Adjusted net income for the period was $181 million, or $0.60 per share, after excluding a pretax charge of $5 million resulting from the resolution of certain insurance matters.

Reported net income for the prior year third quarter was $128 million, or $0.37 per share. Adjusted net income for the period was $148 million, or $0.43 per share, after excluding costs associated with the settlement of a disputed land transaction, certain restructuring costs and costs relating to shareholder activities.

"We continue to be extremely pleased with the strength of homebuyer demand and the sustained course of the housing recovery," said Ryan Marshall , President and CEO of PulteGroup. "Despite the disruptions caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, our 11% increase in year-over-year orders for the quarter points to the health of the market, while the 15% increase in our backlog puts us in an excellent position to deliver strong fourth quarter and full-year financial results."

"Fueled by growing demand among first-time buyers and supported by a strong economy, high employment, and historically low interest rates, U.S. new home sales for 2017 are expected to grow a healthy 5% to 10% over last year," added Marshall. "We remain optimistic about the strength of future housing demand, as the current housing cycle moves into its seventh year of growth."

Third Quarter Results

Home sale revenues for the third quarter increased 9% over the prior year to $2.1 billion. Higher revenues for the period were driven by a 2% increase in deliveries to 5,151 homes, combined with a 7%, or $25,000, increase in average sales price to $399,000.

Home sale gross margin for the third quarter was 23.9%, which is down 80 basis points from the prior year, but is up 50 basis points from the Company's second quarter 2017 adjusted gross margin of 23.4%. Homebuilding SG&A expense for the quarter of $237 million, or 11.6% of home sale revenues, included a $5 million charge associated with the resolution of certain insurance matters. Prior year SG&A of $251 million, or 13.3% of home sale revenues, included approximately $12 million of charges for certain restructuring costs and shareholder activities.

Net new orders for the third quarter increased 11% to 5,300 homes, while the value of new orders increased 23% over the prior year to $2.3 billion. The Company operated out of 778 communities for the third quarter, which is up 10% over the third quarter of 2016.

Ending backlog for the quarter was up 15% over the prior year to 10,823 homes, as backlog value gained 26% to $4.7 billion. The average price of homes in backlog increased 10% over the prior year to $431,000, which is a 10 year high for the Company.

The Company's financial services operations reported third quarter pretax income of $18 million compared with $21 million in 2016. The decrease in pretax income for the period was primarily the result of a more competitive operating environment which impacted pricing during the period. Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 80%, compared with 81% in the prior year.

During the quarter, the Company repurchased 10.4 million common shares for $260 million, or an average price of $25.11 per share.

A conference call discussing PulteGroup 's third quarter 2017 results is scheduled for Tuesday, October 24, 2017, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Interested investors can access the live webcast via PulteGroup 's corporate website at www.pultegroupinc.com.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

24 Oct 2017 06:30 ET 
Press Release: PulteGroup   Reports Third Quarter -3-

This report contains information about our operating results reflecting certain adjustments, including adjustments to cost of revenues, selling general, and administrative expenses, income before income taxes, income tax expense, net income, diluted earnings per share, and operating margin. These measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under the SEC's rules and should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP financial measures as measures of our profitability. We believe that reflecting these adjustments provides investors relevant and useful information for evaluating the comparability of financial information presented and comparing our profitability to other companies in the homebuilding industry. Although other companies in the homebuilding industry report similar information, the methods used may differ. We urge investors to understand the methods used by other companies in the homebuilding industry to calculate these measures and any adjustments thereto before comparing our measures to those of such other companies.

The following tables set forth a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures that management believes to be most directly comparable ($000's omitted):
