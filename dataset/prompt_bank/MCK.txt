0352 GMT - Bendigo & Adelaide Bank is down 3.9% following a cautious speech to shareholders from the regional lender's managing director. Patersons Securities notes that total balance sheet growth will be relatively flat this half in the wake of macroprudential controls on investor mortgage lending and heightened competition. What was left unsaid by the bank was the profit impact of any slowing in the broader housing market, Patersons adds. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)

0221 GMT - Shares of New China Life Insurance are lower early Tuesday, in the wake of shareholder Swiss Re Direct Investments selling half of its stake on the country's 6th biggest life insurance policy writer, with a 6-month lock-up on the remaining shares. The 6 block trades totaling 75 million shares at HK$47.3 apiece, which was near the low end of an indicative range, translates to a discount of 5.5% to the previous close. Smartkarma analyst Sumeet Singh finds no convincing reason for buying the stock, citing expensive valuations as a major factor. At HK$48.55, NCI is now down 3%, but it's still up a lofty 36% year to date. (john.wu@wsj.com)

0044 GMT - Shares of HSBC will likely stand firm today on the back of a future share buyback guidance. With 71% of an existing $2 billion share purchase plan now completed, the global banking group says it has as much as $10 billion in extra cash to spend on further buybacks under suitable conditions. The stock jumped briefly late in Monday's session following the release of 3Q17 earnings yet closed in negative territory. Deutsche Bank keeps its hold rating on HSBC , saying core earnings in line with expectations and benign capital levels won't change market expectations on buybacks and payouts. (john.wu@wsj.com)

2331 GMT [Dow Jones ] Macquarie gets a number of ticks from Shaw & Partners that support its bullish call on the stock. After a meeting with management, Shaw notes Macquarie's share buyback plan due to increasingly predictable earnings, solid performance fees and pipeline of assets, as well as the prospect of tax cuts in the U.S. that should add more than 5% to earnings. And, it adds, investors can still buy exposure to that at about 13 times forecast earnings. Shares are down 0.2% early, after hitting a record high Monday. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)

2300 GMT - Wholesale funding trends continue to look supportive for Australian bank margins near term, even taking into account the issue of longer-dated debt, Deutsche Bank says. It notes key indicators have been stable to slightly positive for the major banks over the last month, with credit-default swap spreads improving modestly and remaining near the lowest levels in three years. The bank bill overnight index swap spread also improved, while the AUD/USD cross swap spread was unchanged, Deutsche adds. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)

2205 GMT - AT&T and Verizon fell on the news that Sprint was walking away from merger talks with T-Mobile . T was down 1.3% and VZ was down 2.2%. That might seem counterintuitive given that the smaller carriers had said the tie-up would make it easier to take on their larger rivals. But the reality is investors believe the merger would result in less competition. Together, T-Mobile and Sprint would be roughly the same size as AT&T and might not slash prices in order to increase market share. If T-Mobile and Sprint are ever able to reach a deal, antitrust officials at the DOJ might take this signal into consideration. (ryan.knutson@wsj.com ; @ryan_knutson)

2159 GMT - Venture capitalists are betting again on an entrepreneur who helped pioneer a method of treating faulty heart valves without surgery. Georg Börtlein co-founded CoreValve, which developed a catheter-based system used to replace aortic valves in the heart. Medtronic acquired CoreValve in 2009 for more than $700M. Venture-capital firm Sofinnova Partners , a CoreValve investor, is leading a EUR12.3M ($14.3M) financing for Börtlein's new company, HighLife. HighLife is developing a catheter-based treatment for another heart-valve condition, mitral regurgitation, in which blood leaks back backward through the mitral valve. Physicians already perform catheter-based mitral-valve repair. HighLife is testing a mitral-valve replacement system, betting that valve replacement will prove more effective than repair.

2043 GMT - Experts have speculated for months whether President Trump would fire Richard Cordray , Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The president may not have known or cared about Cordray enough to take such a major step. In a surprise revelation, the Obama appointee, says the two "have never met or spoken." The statement was part of a letter Cordray sent to Trump Monday, urging him to veto a bill approved by GOP lawmakers last week to overturn his agency's "arbitration" rule designed to make it easy for consumers to sue banks in groups. Cordray acknowledged that many thought writing the missive was a waste of time because Trump had already expressed support for the bill. But he tried to give the president a push anyway by appealing to his litigious nature. (yuka.hayashi@wsj.com)

1932 GMT - Canadian medicinal marijuana producer Canopy Growth hit a new year-to-date high following The Wall Street Journal's report that US Corona distributor Constellation Brands took a 9.9% stake in the Canadian firm. The stake, worth about C$245M, will provide Canopy with some marketing and branding heft ahead of the Canadian government 's plans to legalize marijuana next July. The announcement also helped to push much of Canada's listed cannabis-companies higher for the day, while the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF was up about 5%.

1707 GMT - Pressure on companies that make or distribute opioid painkillers continues to grow from a variety of sources, as seen in a shareholder campaign being waged by state treasurers, asset managers and labor funds with over $1.3T in assets. The coalition says it's filing shareholder proposals at 10 firms in which its members hold shares, including pharmaceutical distributors McKesson and Cardinal Health , and painkiller manufacturers Endo, Insys and JNJ. The proposals ask independent directors to investigate how the companies "are responding to increasing business risks related to opioids." The shareholder group is also calling for executive compensation policies that "deter misconduct." The coalition includes treasurers from California, Illinois, Connecticut, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, labor funds including the Teamsters and "faith-based investors" including hospital operator Trinity Health.

1648 GMT - Avolon offers a bullish assessment of aircraft demand, with the big leasing company projecting annual passenger traffic growth of 5.4% over the next 20 years, compared with 4.4% and 4.7% in the respective Airbus and Boeing market outlooks. That translates into around 5,000 more jets over 100 seats plus freighters over the period compared to the plane makers' forecasts. Avolon also expects Boeing to claim "close to" half of single-aisle deliveries, despite recent sales trends, as well as a larger share of twin-aisle and freighter jets.
