About Harpoon Therapeutics

Harpoon Therapeutics is an immuno-oncology company founded by Patrick Baeuerle, PhD , a pioneer in the development of T-cell engaging therapies, and MPM Capital . The company is focused on the discovery and development of novel T-cell engaging biologics for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. Harpoon Therapeutics created a novel T-cell recruiting drug discovery platform called TriTAC (tri-specific T-cell activating construct) to unleash the targeted cell-killing properties of a patient's own immune system through T-cell activation. This approach is being optimized to penetrate tissues and extend serum exposure, and has the potential to address a broad range of cancers, including solid tumors, and immunologic diseases. HPN424, a prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting TriTAC biologic, is in development for the treatment of prostate cancer and is expected to enter a clinical trial in 2018.
