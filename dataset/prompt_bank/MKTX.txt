2148 GMT - ISS recommends shareholders support EQT's planned purchase of Rice Energy , which is under pressure from activist Jana and hedge fund DE Shaw. The opinion sent shares of both EQT and Rice popping, and almost entirely eliminated the deal spread. While ISS rejects shareholder idea to shoot down the deal, ISS does give them backing on key argument to break up EQT, even if it takes place after the deal. ISS says even though the deal is "only mildly accretive" it could "deliver meaningful value if it facilitates the resolution of EQT's sum-of-the-parts discount." ISS applauds management for making promises, under pressure, to commit to reassure investors. Rice ends up 8.4% to $28.51, EQT up 5.4% to $63.31. Deal would be worth $28.72/share for Rice at those prices. (david.benoit@wsj.com; @DaveCBenoit)

2003 GMT - Fitch affirms its ratings for Canada's banks Friday, but adds they could be vulnerable to a housing market correction. Fitch rates the Royal Bank of Canada at AA, and the other large banks--CIBC, Toronto-Dominion Bank , Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal at AA-. The ratings firm lowers the outlook for CIBC to negative from stable, citing higher mortgage lending. The banks benefit from strong operations, but are exposed to a housing market where prices are overvalued by roughly 25%, says Fitch. Meanwhile consumer debt to disposable income is at 169.9%, the highest in the G7. (vipal.monga@wsj.com ; @vipalmonga)

1453 GMT - Warren Buffett reiterated at an event Thursday that the market for bitcoin is in bubble territory. Bitcoin is trading around $5,780, according to www.dailyfx.com, more than eight times higher than this time a year ago. The cryptocurrency has risen recently, but failed to breach the psychologically significant $6,000 level. Buffett says he remains skeptical on bitcoin because one can't put value on it since it isn't a value-producing asset. Other prominent people in the financial world have also criticized bitcoin, including JPMorgan's CEO James Dimon . Goldman Sachs , however, may introduce a trading desk for bitcoin, according to reports, one of the reasons why the blockchain-backed currency has risen recently. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)

1432 GMT - A U.S. fine for Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC over its role in packaging toxic sub-prime mortgages before the financial crisis could snuff out hopes of its first profit in a decade, says Hargreaves Lansdown . RBS said Friday it was optimistic about reaching a deal this year with the U.S. Department of Justice . Analysts expect any fine to run to several billion dollars. "RBS faces the indignity of suffering a tenth year without a profit, though this really all depends on the timing and size of the fine," says HL's Laith Khalaf . "The fact the bank has said it expects to be profitable next year suggests RBS is bracing for a pretty imminent rap on the knuckles." RBS shares rise 2% to 287 pence. (philip.waller@wsj.com)

1422 GMT - Investors' appetite for risky assets is picking up. The pace of inflows into corporate bonds and equity funds has accelerated in recent weeks, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysis of EPFR Global data, with the two posting a combined $534B in inflows year-to-date--on track for their biggest inflows ever.

1419 GMT - Intercontinental Exchange is making a play for Canada after UK regulators blocked its effort to beef up its presence in European energy markets. That's the upshot of ICE 's deal to sell Trayport , a UK-based provider of energy-trading software, to TMX Group , owner of the Toronto Stock Exchange. Under the deal, announced this morning, ICE will sell Trayport to TMX in exchange for GBP350M in cash ($460M) and two of TMX's assets: NGX, an Alberta-based electricity and natural gas exchange, and Shorcan Energy Brokers, a crude oil brokerage. The deal, expected to close later this year or early next year, subject to regulatory approval, would further expand ICE 's already large footprint in North American energy markets. The UK's antitrust watchdog ruled last year that ICE had to sell Trayport , whose technology is heavily used in European utilities trading. The Atlanta-based exchange operator agreed to buy Trayport in 2015 for $650M. (alexo@wsj.com; @aosipovich)

1403 GMT - Bonds backed by CVS and Aetna have sagged after The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the companies are in merger talks, with CVS mulling a price of more than $66B for the health insurer. At that price and not including potential synergies, CVS would likely need to fund the deal with at least 60% equity to remain investment-grade, according to CreditSights. That would mean new debt of around $25B and put rent-adjusted leverage of the combined company in the 4.0x area, per CreditSights. CVS's 5.125% bonds due 2045 traded Friday morning at 145 basis points above Treasurys, up from 136 basis points before the Journal story, according to MarketAxess. The spread on Aetna 's 3.875% notes due 2047 moved up to 125 basis points from 95 basis points. (sam.goldfarb@wsj.com)
