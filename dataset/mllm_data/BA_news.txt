*Market-Sensitive*: Boeing (BA) and Air Lease Corporation (AL) secured a milestone with LOT Polish Airlines as the first Central & East European carrier to operate the 737 MAX. LOT will lease six 737 MAX 8s from AL (NYSE: AL), part of AL’s 129 MAX orders, enhancing fleet efficiency and route expansion. Boeing’s MAX, with over 4,000 global orders, reinforces its dominance in single-aisle demand.  

**Financial Implications**:  
- **BA** (+0.5% pre-market) benefits from sustained MAX demand amid fierce Airbus competition.  
- LOT’s fleet modernization (adding four 787-9s by 2019) signals aggressive growth, targeting 42 new routes since 2016, including long-haul (Warsaw-Los Angeles, Budapest-Chicago).  
- **Regulatory**: MAX deliveries may face scrutiny post-2019 grounding, but this early adoption underscores restored confidence.  

**Outlook**: Positive for BA’s backlog and AL’s leasing portfolio, though geopolitical risks (Eastern Europe demand) warrant monitoring.  

*Data Points*: MAX orders: 4,000+; AL’s MAX orders: 129; LOT’s 787-9 additions: 4.  

*Analyst View*: Execution on deliveries critical for BA’s 2018 revenue guidance.
