LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE: LYB) today announced earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter 2017 of $1.1 billion, or $2.67 per share. In September, LyondellBasell 's interest in the Geosel pipeline and storage system in France was sold for an after-tax gain of $103 million that increased third quarter earnings by $0.26 per share. Third quarter 2017 EBITDA was $1.8 billion.

"LyondellBasell 's portfolio of global businesses demonstrated strong performance in the third quarter with EBITDA in our Intermediates and Derivatives segment improving by more than 30% relative to the third quarter of 2016 and continued strong results from our Olefins and Polyolefins -- Europe, Asia and International segment," said Bob Patel , LyondellBasell CEO.

"On the U.S. Gulf Coast, our commitment to hurricane preparedness enabled safe plant operations during Hurricane Harvey. We are deeply grateful for the selfless dedication and commitment of our employees toward both restoring our businesses and supporting our communities during this unprecedented storm. We estimate that lost sales volumes valued at third quarter margins and additional related costs due to the storm impacted third quarter results by approximately $200 million. Margin improvements during September provided a partial offset to the lost production and higher costs," Patel said.

"During the third quarter, LyondellBasell advanced our growth strategy by opening a new polypropylene compounds plant in China and reaching final investment decision for our next propylene oxide (PO) plant while generating approximately $1.5 billion of cash flow from operating activity and returning $652 million to shareholders. With Standard & Poor's raising our senior unsecured debt to BBB+, the rating on our long-term debt now matches our strong corporate investment-grade credit ratings," said Patel.

OUTLOOK

"Hurricane Harvey reduced inventories across the petrochemical industry and contributed to further delays in the startup of new U.S. ethylene and derivative capacity. As the industry works to rebuild inventories during the fourth quarter, we expect global markets will remain tight to balanced for the remainder of 2017 and the industry will be better positioned to absorb capacity additions during 2018," Patel said.

Three months ended September 30, 2017 versus three months ended June 30, 2017 -- EBITDA decreased $243 million versus the second quarter 2017. Compared to the prior period, olefin results declined approximately $260 million. Ethylene margins fell approximately 5 cents per pound primarily due to increasing feedstock prices. Sales volumes also declined due to production outages related to Hurricane Harvey. Combined polyolefin results were relatively unchanged. Improvements in polyethylene volume and polyethylene spreads over ethylene were offset by reduced volumes in polypropylene combined with polypropylene prices lagging propylene price increases. Joint venture equity income decreased by $3 million.

Three months ended September 30, 2017 versus three months ended September 30, 2016 -- EBITDA decreased $66 million versus the third quarter 2016. Olefin results declined approximately $130 million primarily due to a decrease in ethylene margin from reduced ethylene price and increased feedstock costs. Net ethylene production increased 8 percent due to planned maintenance and expansion in the third quarter 2016 at Corpus Christi and planned maintenance at Morris which exceeded the Harvey volume impacts in the third quarter 2017. Combined polyolefin results increased approximately $40 million primarily due to a polyethylene spread improvement over ethylene of approximately 5 cents per pound. Joint venture equity income declined by $4 million.

Olefins and Polyolefins - Europe, Asia, and International (O&P-EAI) -- Our O&P--EAI segment produces and markets olefins and co-products, polyethylene and polypropylene, including polypropylene compounds.

Three months ended September 30, 2017 versus three months ended June 30, 2017 -- EBITDA decreased by $1 million versus the second quarter 2017. The third quarter benefited $108 million from the sale of LyondellBasell 's interest in Geosel. Olefin results decreased approximately $100 million primarily due to declining co-product prices. Combined polyolefin results decreased approximately $10 million with reduced margins partially offset by increased volume. Joint venture equity income was relatively unchanged.

Three months ended September 30, 2017 versus three months ended September 30, 2016 -- EBITDA increased by $114 million versus the third quarter 2016. The third quarter 2017 benefited $108 million from the sale of LyondellBasell 's interest in Geosel. Third quarter 2016 included an $11 million benefit from the restructuring of Asian polypropylene joint ventures and the sale of Australian polypropylene assets. Olefin results decreased by approximately $15 million as higher feedstock prices led to declining ethylene margins. Combined polyolefin results increased by approximately $10 million with increased sales volumes partially offset by declining polyethylene spreads. Joint venture equity income was relatively unchanged.

Intermediates and Derivatives (I&D) -- Our I&D segment produces and markets propylene oxide (PO) and its derivatives, oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemicals, such as styrene monomer, acetyls, ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol.

Press Release: LyondellBasell  Reports Third -2-

Three months ended September 30, 2017 versus three months ended June 30, 2017 -- EBITDA increased $63 million versus the second quarter 2017. PO and derivatives results increased approximately $25 million. Volumes improved resulting from the completion of planned maintenance at our plant in Botlek, The Netherlands in the second quarter which were partially offset by production losses in the third quarter due to Hurricane Harvey. Intermediate chemicals results increased approximately $15 million, primarily due to a 2 cent per pound improvement in styrene margins. Volumes declined for most intermediate chemicals except for an increase in methanol volumes due to the completion of second quarter planned maintenance. Oxyfuels and related products results increased by approximately $25 million primarily due to increased volumes from the completion of planned maintenance at Botlek. Joint venture equity income increased by $4 million.

Three months ended September 30, 2017 versus three months ended September 30, 2016 -- EBITDA increased $98 million versus the third quarter 2016. PO and derivatives results increased by approximately $35 million as both margins and volumes improved. Intermediate chemicals results increased by approximately $85 million primarily due to margin improvements in styrene, methanol and ethylene glycol which more than offset volume declines related to Hurricane Harvey. Oxyfuels and related products results declined by approximately $20 million primarily due to hurricane related production losses. Joint venture equity income was relatively unchanged.

Refining -- The primary products of this segment include gasoline and distillates, including diesel fuel, heating oil and jet fuel.

Three months ended September 30, 2017 versus three months ended June 30, 2017 -- EBITDA increased $33 million versus the second quarter 2017. The Houston refinery operated at 240,000 barrels per day, 25,000 barrels per day less than the prior quarter due to reduced rates as a result of Hurricane Harvey. A $2.27 increase in the Maya 2-1-1 to $21.81 was partially offset by unfavorable heavy to light differentials on by-product margins.

Three months ended September 30, 2017 versus three months ended September 30, 2016 -- EBITDA increased $68 million versus the third quarter 2016. Third quarter 2017 throughput increased by 31,000 barrels per day with operational disruptions in the third quarter of 2016 exceeding reduced rates in the third quarter 2017 due to Hurricane Harvey. A $2.83 increase in the Maya 2-1-1 to $21.81 was partially offset by unfavorable heavy to light differentials on by-product margins.

Technology Segment -- Our Technology segment develops and licenses chemical and polyolefin process technologies and manufactures and sells polyolefin catalysts.

INFORMATION RELATED TO FINANCIAL MEASURES

This release makes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

EBITDA, as presented herein, may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure reported by other companies due to differences in the way the measure is calculated. We calculate EBITDA as income from continuing operations plus interest expense (net), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation & amortization. EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to profit or operating profit for any period as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to operating cash flows as a measure of our liquidity.

Quantitative reconciliations of EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, are provided in Table 8 at the end of this release.
