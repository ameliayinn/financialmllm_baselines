Fitch Ratings-New York-06 October 2017: Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for Xylem at 'BBB' and the Short-Term IDR at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The ratings apply to approximately $2.4 billion in total debt. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of the release.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Fitch expects the company to generate roughly $4.7 billion in revenue for full-year 2017, which would be a 25% increase from prior year, largely driven by the Sensus acquisition. On a pro forma basis, Fitch expects organic revenue to grow by 3% to 4% annually. Fitch notes that the company's Water Infrastructure segment no longer includes the results of the Analytics business on a stand-alone basis, as it is not combined with Sensus and Visenti segments effective second quarter 2017 (2Q17).

In 2Q17, the company experienced an 8% increase in orders with double-digit growth in treatment orders which typically signals strength in the water utility sector. The company generated 16.6% EBITDA margins through June 30, 2017 up from 16% for fiscal year (FY) 2016. Fitch expects margins to gradually expand as the company continues to successfully integrate the Sensus acquisition and rise above 17% in the medium term. Fitch expects much of the margin enhancement to come from revenue synergies generated by recent acquisitions in addition to scalable organic revenue across all segments.

XYL experienced 2% organic growth in the Sensus & Analytics segment over prior year through 2Q17 driven by strength in smart electric, smart gas and Saas verticals. The segment has seen particularly strong performance with the Sensus Stratus electric meter which helps electric utilities and municipalities better balance supply and demand and restore service faster following outages. On a consolidated basis, organic growth through 2Q17 was largely powered by the residential end market as it gained 15% over the prior year, followed by the commercial and industrial end markets which contributed 3% and 2% of organic growth respectively. Alternatively, the public utility end market saw 4% organic decline during the same period. Geographically, the vast majority of organic growth was powered by E.M. which saw 7% growth over the prior year compared to a flat U.S. region and a 3% decline in Western Europe.

Fitch expects XYL's debt/EBITDA for year-end 2017 to fall to roughly 3.0x as the company continues to de-lever following the Sensus acquisition. This compares to a debt/EBITDA level of 4.0x and 3.5x as of Dec. 31, 2016 and June 30, 2017 respectively. Fitch further expects the company's total adjusted debt/EBITDAR for FY2017 to be roughly 3.3x falling to 2.8x by FY2019 driven by expanding margins. XYL's funds from operations (FFO) adjusted leverage as of June 30, 2017 was 4.5x, down from 5.1x as of Dec. 31, 2016. Fitch expects the company's FFO adjusted leverage to be roughly 3.8x for FY2017 and 3.3x by FY2019. Fitch further expects the company to grow free cash flow (FCF) toward its recent historic levels. Fitch expects the company to generate approximately $250 million in (post-dividend) FCF for FY2017 or a roughly 5% FCF margin. This compares to the 6.7% and 6.9% FCF margins generated in FY2015 and FY2016 respectively, with the decline largely driven by working capital needs. Fitch further expects the company's FCF margin to rebound toward 6% or 7% in the medium term.

Fitch remains concerned with XYL's currency risk given that through June 30, 2017, the company generated roughly 54% of its revenue from non-U.S. operations, which is down from 59% for the same period prior year, largely driven by the Sensus acquisition. The company's exposure to currency risk is somewhat offset by its EUR500 million notes which mature in March of 2023. This risk is further mitigated by XYL's limited exposure to the most volatile currencies in the world today. Xylem's combined exposure to the Middle East, Africa and Latin America is roughly 10% of revenue. Further, XYL hedges up to 75% of its net primary foreign currency transactional exposure with its annual hedging program.

XYL's net pension obligation was approximately $854 million (66% funded) as of December 2016. The domestic post-retirement benefit obligation (PBO) totalled only $100 million whereas the international plan represents the lion's share with $754 million in obligations. The company's domestic plan is 69% funded and has been closed to new employees since 2011. XYL contributed $27 million and $25 million to pension and retirement benefits in 2016 and 2015 respectively. Contributions for 2017 are expected to be approximately $30 million and totalled $13 million through the first six months of 2017 compared to $14 million during the same period in 2016. Fitch believes that the pension obligations are manageable due to the company's solid FCF generation.

Fitch expects XYL to rely on internally generated cash to fund its balanced cash deployment strategy in 2017 and beyond. The firm's strategy will be focused on capital expenditures and bolt-on acquisitions. Fitch notes that the company's R&D as a portion of revenue has climbed following the Sensus acquisition to 3.8% of revenue YTD, which is up from 2.9% for FY2016. Fitch expects R&D to remain in the high 3% range in the medium term, with the potential to rise incrementally depending on future acquisitions. Fitch expects the company to prioritize accretive acquisitions over share repurchases, though a return to pre-Sensus repurchases levels (which peaked at $158 million in 2015) in the absence of any sizable acquisitions would be within Fitch's Base Case scenario. As of June 30, 2017, the company retains $413 million in authorization under its share repurchase program.

DERIVATION SUMMARY

Fitch considers XYL's overall enterprise risk level to be relatively low, as its credit profile is stronger than its diversified industrial peers, reflecting a combination of Xylem's size, market position and conservative financial policies. Significant aftermarket and replacement equipment content, which accounts for nearly 40% of revenue, further underpins its credit profile. Peers such as Flowserve , ITT and IDEX are all well capitalized and have global scale, making them strong competitors, however XYL's low margin volatility and consistent FCF generation allows it an incremental measure financial flexibility.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include:

--Limited future negative impacts from currency fluctuations;

--Consolidated EBITDA margins of at least 16% through the medium term;

--Moderate annual increases in the size of the dividend;

--Capex of roughly 3.2% of revenue through the medium term;

--R&D of roughly 3.8% of revenue through the medium term.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action

--An increase in adjusted debt/EBITDAR above 3.0x on a sustained basis;

--An increase in FFO adjusted leverage above 3.50x on a sustained basis;

--FCF margin below 1.5% for a prolonged period;

--Debt-funded acquisition or shareholder-friendly activity.

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action

--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR below 2.0x for a sustained period;

--FCF margins above 7% for a prolonged period.

LIQUIDITY

Fitch expects XYL's financial flexibility to remain adequate to meet its obligations over the medium term supported by adequate liquidity. The company's aggregate liquidity stands at approximately $789 million at 2Q17 comprised of $288 million (Fitch notes that $270 million was held internationally) of cash and equivalents and roughly $501 million of availability under its senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The company utilizes its commercial paper program as a means of short-term funding as it has a combined outstanding limit of $600 million inclusive of its revolving credit facility which had $99 million outstanding as of June 30, 2017. The company's credit facility matures in March of 2020.
