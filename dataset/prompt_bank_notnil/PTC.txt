The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2020.

"I am pleased to announce that we have already achieved two of our top three priorities for 2020 by attaining a second investment grade rating and reducing our coal generation to 29%. With our year-to-date performance, we are on track to accomplish our third priority of delivering our guidance," said Andrés Gluski , AES President and Chief Executive Officer. "By leveraging our Green Blend and Extend strategy and our development pipeline, we added 556 MW of renewables, bringing our year-to-date total to 2.1 GW and our backlog to 6.8 GW. At the same time, Fluence continues to maintain its global leadership position in the energy storage market, with 2.4 GW delivered or awarded and its recent acquisition of AMS , the leading provider of AI-enabled bidding software for utility-scale storage and generation assets."

"We are very excited by the recent upgrade to investment grade from S&P, which again highlights the material transformation of our portfolio and balance sheet over the last several years," said Gustavo Pimenta , AES Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "Furthermore, the 35% sell-down of the Southland repowering demonstrates the significant intrinsic value of our assets. This year, we have announced asset sale proceeds of $650 million, above our $550 million target. We will recycle this capital by investing in renewables and innovative solutions to further transform our portfolio and deliver superior returns to our shareholders."

Key Q3 2020 Financial Results

Third quarter 2020 Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations (Diluted EPS) was ($0.50), a decrease of $0.82 compared to third quarter 2019, primarily reflecting higher impairments and losses on sales in 2020 of $1.13, as well as lower contributions from the Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean (MCAC) Strategic Business Unit (SBU). These impacts were partially offset by a lower income tax expense and higher margins from the South America SBU, largely due to net gains from early contract terminations at Angamos.

Third quarter 2020 Adjusted Earnings Per Share(1) (Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure) was $0.42, a decrease of $0.06 compared to third quarter 2019, primarily reflecting cumulative outage-related insurance recovery of $0.05 collected in the third quarter of 2019 at the MCAC SBU.

THE AES CORPORATION

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

(Unaudited)

RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED PRE-TAX CONTRIBUTION (PTC) AND ADJUSTED EPS

Adjusted PTC is defined as pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; (f) costs directly associated with a major restructuring program, including, but not limited to, workforce reduction efforts, relocations, and office consolidation; and (g) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the South America SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence . Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis adjusted for the same gains or losses excluded from consolidated entities.

Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and the tax impact from the repatriation of sales proceeds, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; (f) costs directly associated with a major restructuring program, including, but not limited to, workforce reduction efforts, relocations, and office consolidation; (g) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the South America SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence ; and (h) tax benefit or expense related to the enactment effects of 2017 U.S. tax law reform and related regulations and any subsequent period adjustments related to enactment effects.

The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted PTC is income from continuing operations attributable to AES . The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. We believe that Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS better reflect the underlying business performance of the Company and are considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions or equity securities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests, retire debt or implement restructuring activities, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, for Adjusted PTC, earnings before tax represents the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS should not be construed as alternatives to income from continuing operations attributable to AES and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which are determined in accordance with GAAP.
