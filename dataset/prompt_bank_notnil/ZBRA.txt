LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 16, 2017-- 

Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ: ZBRA), the market leader in rugged mobile computers, barcode scanners and barcode printers enhanced with software and services to enable real-time enterprise visibility, today announced the company received the coveted Brandon Hall Group award for excellence in three categories: the Silver award for Best Learning Program Supporting a Change Transformation Business Strategy as well as Bronze awards for Best Use of Video for Learning and Best Use of Virtual Worlds for Learning.

The Silver award for Best Learning Program Supporting a Change Transformation Business Strategy highlights Zebra's business transformation journey following its acquisition of the enterprise business from Motorola Solutions, Inc . Accenture and Zebra's Change Management teams ensured business readiness through learning and communications supporting the largest integration of systems and processes in Zebra's history with the goal of building One Zebra.

The Bronze award for Best Use of Video for Learning recognizes Zebra's use of 3D animation videos, applying the same innovation used in our solutions to our learning tools. This also enables new opportunities for customer user adoption and expands the possibilities of what Zebra can offer to address their business challenges.

The Bronze Award for Best Use of Virtual Worlds for Learning leverages the 3D interactive models of new devices, making them virtually accessible to Zebra's sales team before units are physically available for a broader audience. Learners can orbit and look at them from various angles and distances based on what they want to explore at the given moment. Key selling points and physical device feature annotations were added to give context. This was used for the TC8000 touch mobile computer, MP7000 grocery scanner scale, and the ZT600 Series industrial printers.

SUPPORTING QUOTES

Mike Cooke, CEO, Brandon Hall Group

"Our conference is unique because most of our presenters are Excellence Awards winners. These are executives and directors of world-class organizations who have done the hard work necessary to drive business results through learning, talent management, leadership development, talent acquisition, and workforce management. They have compelling stories to tell that you cannot get anywhere else."

Rachel Cooke, COO, Brandon Hall Group and Head of the Awards Program

"Excellence Award winners symbolize the power and impact that Human Capital Management (HCM) practices can have on a business or on any organization. Many organizations can have great HCM initiatives, but the standard of excellence only applies for organizations whose HCM practices truly benefit the business. That's what the Excellence Awards program stands for, and that is what Brandon Hall Group stands for."

Emily Cates, Head of Global Knowledge Center, Zebra Technologies

"We are honored to receive this recognition. These prestigious awards are significant in the Learning & Development industry as they demonstrate Zebra's commitment to learning innovation and cutting-edge change management as it impacts business transformation."
