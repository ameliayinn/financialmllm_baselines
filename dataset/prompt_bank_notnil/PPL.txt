Scana and other utilities got a bit of relief on Friday, but it's been a difficult week for them overall. For the week, PG&E Corp. ( PCG), yesterday's biggest loser, is off 16%, and PPL Corp. ( PPL), is down 8.4%. Before today's gains, Scana was off 15.8% for the week; with the rise, it's now down 12.2% for the week.

The shares got hit when earlier this week regulators said they might force the utility to return money to customers that it had collected for a now defunct nuclear expansion plan.

Scana has fallen 46.8% this year.
