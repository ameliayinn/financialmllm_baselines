1422 ET - Tyson Foods says its chairman John Tyson received $1.35M for private use of corporate aircraft in the meat giant's just-completed fiscal 2017, the highest annual figure since Tyson began breaking out the perquisite over a decade ago. Tyson, whose grandfather founded the company, has previously topped a list of Fortune 100 company officials for compensation for personal jet travel, and in 2016 he received $1.29M in such compensation. The Tyson family owns nearly all "supervoting" shares, giving the family majority voting power among shareholders. A Tyson spokeswoman says that Tyson's employment contract specifically permits his personal use of company-owned aircraft. Tyson's shares are up 32% this year, thanks to favorable profit margins in its core chicken business and growth in its prepared foods products, versus a 19.8% gain in the S&P 500.

1417 ET - TJX urged shareholders not to participate in a mini-tender offer by TRC Capital Corp ., which is seeking to buy up to 2 million shares at a below-market price. The offering price of $70.95 is 4.34% below $74.17, the closing price of TJX 's stock on Dec. 15, the last closing price before the offer was made. TJX , which owns T.J. Maxx , Marshalls and HomeGoods , is the latest company to be targeted by the Canadian investment firm. It offers to buy shares from investors at below market prices in the hopes that investors won't compare the offer price to the latest closing price, enabling it to lock in a quick profit. TJX said the Securities and Exchange Commission has cautioned investors about participating in such offers. Shares slip 0.2% to $75.87. (suzanne.kapner@wsj.com)

1406 ET - Chipotle said it is looking into claims made on the websites iwaspoisoned.com and yelp.com of illnesses associated with eating at one of its Los Angeles restaurants. The chain, whose sales and stock price have been battered by food safety issues over the last two years, said the reports have not been validated and that it has not been contacted by any customers directly and is not aware of any reports having been made to the local health department. Five reports have been posted on iwaspoisoned.com representing seven people who claimed to have gotten sick after eating different dishes at the same Los Angeles location. The company said it has implemented "heightened preventative procedures" at the restaurant, which it does as a matter of course even if illness reports aren't substantiated. Shares of Chipotle are down 3.6%. (julie.jargon@wsj.com)

1404 ET - The persistent threat of a sanctions snapback from the Trump administration coupled with a more confrontational approach are putting Iran's oil prospects at risk in 2018, says Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets . "Even if Trump renews the waivers in January, the issue will continuously come up every quarter and serve as something of a Damocles Sword over the nuclear deal," she says, potentially curtailing "foreign investment in the Iranian energy sector and imperil output expansion plans." A snapback could also "force foreign refineries to source less crude from Iran, especially if the threat of being locked out of US capital markets were revived," Ms Croft says. In addition, "Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman is also adopting a much more confrontational approach towards Iran, upping the risk of a serious escalation in this regional rivalry next year," she adds.

1354 ET - It's a scrap between nonprofits in the food world, as a group backed by US restaurants and food companies takes aim at one of the top animal-welfare advocates. The Center for Consumer Freedom, funded in part by the food industry, filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission against the Humane Society of the US over alleged "deceptive advertising" and misrepresenting its spending to donors. The CCF, which has also protested soda taxes and defended genetically engineered crops, says the HSUS is masquerading as a pet shelter operator as it campaigns against the US meat industry; an HSUS spokeswoman calls the complaint the latest in a series of failed efforts to dry up HSUS funding.

1346 ET - Be on the lookout for more announcements of coal plant retirements next year, especially in areas where natural gas is readily and cheaply available, BTU Analytics' Matthew Hoza tells WSJ. The analyst says that after the wave of retirements last year, there are still more than 100 non-retiring coal plants that are operating at dangerously low utilizations below the 31% utilization that officially retiring plants were operating at. "It's hard to argue that low utilizations are sustainable in the long-term," he says, adding in a new report that "the coal plants most at risk come from areas that are on top of or adjacent to the Marcellus and Utica, where we have seen prolific natural gas production growth over the past few years."

1334 ET - With a sweeping tax bill now en route to President Trump's desk for signature, one farm group fears spending cuts hurtful to the nation's farmers are next. Plenty of farm groups supported the Republican tax overhaul, passed now by both the House and Senate. But the National Farmers Union , which advocates for small farmers, predicts danger for programs that support farmers and help low-income families buy food. "This tax bill leaves a $1.5 trillion hole in the budget - a hole that some members of Congress will want to fill with farm program and entitlement spending cuts," said Roger Johnson, the group's president, who vowed to fight cuts during a slump in the farm economy.

1313 ET - Most who work in advertising know the US digital-ad market is dominated by two massive players: Facebook and Alphabet's Google . But by how much? Pivotal Research estimated Google and Facebook made 73% of the $20.8B in US digital ad revenue in 2Q, up from 63% two years prior. Pivotal's last estimated the two behemoths controlled 70% of the market in 1Q last year. Google and Facebook accounted for 83% of all growth in 2Q, Pivotal says. Still, digital advertising is growing so rapidly that other players benefited, too. Digital-ad sales for firms that aren't Google and Facebook grew by 15% in 2Q over a year prior, compared with a 7% growth all of 2016. (jack.nicas@wsj.com; @jacknicas)

1307 ET - Boeing says it will use part of the windfall from corporate tax reform to inject $300M into employee-related activities, split equally between training, workforce facilities upgrades and supporting charitable gift-match programs.

1254 ET - Trailing three-month sales at Emerson's automation solutions unit accelerated to climb 20% through November, which Scott Davis at Melius Research views as "amazingly bullish" for broader capital investment among industrial companies. Davis says on a client call that capital investment is one asset class that hasn't experienced a bubble, even though returns typically average 15% versus 7% for buybacks, 4% for M&A and low single digits for repaying debt.
