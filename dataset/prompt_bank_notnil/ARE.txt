     estate joint venture with Uber Technologies, Inc . ("Uber") was completed

     first installment of $18.9 million was paid in 2Q17. We expect the second 
     and third installments to be paid in 4Q17 and 1Q18, respectively.

(1)  Represents annualized amounts for the quarter ended prior to the date of 
     sale. Net operating income (cash basis) excludes straight-line rent and 
     amortization of acquired below-market leases. 
(2)  In May 2017, we completed the sale of a partial interest in our land 
     parcels at 1401/1413 Research Boulevard, located in our Rockville 
     submarket. The sale was executed with a distinguished retail real estate 
     developer for the development of a 90,000 RSF retail shopping center. We 
     contributed the land parcels at a fair value of $7.9 million into a new 
     entity, our partner contributed $3.9 million, and we received a 
     distribution of $0.7 million. In addition, the real estate joint venture 
     obtained a non-recourse secured construction loan with aggregate 
     commitments of $25.0 million, which is expected to fund the remaining 
     construction costs to complete the project, and we do not expect to make 
     additional equity contributions to the real estate joint venture. 
(3)  Represents the sale of a condominium interest for 49% of the building 
     RSF, or 203,090 RSF, in our unconsolidated real estate joint venture 
     property. Net operating income, net operating income (cash basis), and 
     contractual sales price represent our 27.5% share related to the sale of 
     the condominium interest. In August 2017, the unconsolidated real estate 
     joint venture entered into a mortgage loan agreement, secured by the 
     remaining interest in the property. During the nine months ended 
     September 30, 2017, we received a cash distribution of $38.8 million from 
     the joint venture, primarily from the condominium sale and loan 
     refinancing.

About the Company

Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc . (NYSE : ARE), an S&P 500(R) company, is an urban office real estate investment trust ("REIT") uniquely focused on collaborative life science and technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations, with a total market capitalization of $16.1 billion and an asset base in North America of 28.6 million square feet, as of September 30, 2017. The asset base in North America includes 20.6 million RSF of operating properties, including 1.5 million RSF of development and redevelopment of new Class A properties currently undergoing construction. Additionally, the asset base in North America includes 8.0 million SF of future development projects, including 1.1 million SF of near-term projects undergoing marketing for lease and pre-construction activities and 3.3 million SF of intermediate-term development projects. Founded in 1994, Alexandria pioneered this niche and has since established a significant market presence in key locations, including Greater Boston, San Francisco, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland, and Research Triangle Park. Alexandria has a longstanding and proven track record of developing Class A properties clustered in urban life science and technology campuses that provide its innovative tenants with highly dynamic and collaborative environments that enhance their ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, efficiency, creativity, and success. We believe these advantages result in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value.
