1844 ET - Moody's says it's changing its outlook on Citigroup 's debt to "positive" from "stable," an indication the firm sees improvement in the bank's core business. "Citigroup has largely completed its sweeping reengineering, which has resulted in a more solvent institution with an improved risk-attuned management culture, in part thanks to enhanced regulation," Moody's says. Moody's says it could further upgrade its bond rating on Citigroup if it meets management's "strategic targets without compromising on risk appetite or controls." Citigroup 's senior debt is rated Baa1, which is one notch below the A ratings. (telis.demos@wsj.com; @telisdemos)

1834 ET - Oil futures are down another 1% in Asian trading after falling at least 1.5% overnight, getting further pressure the past several hours by a bearish inventory reading from API. The industry group says crude and gasoline supplies both rose last week, while analysts have been expecting Wednesday's government reading to show slight declines in both. Some selling has been overdue amid the run to 2-year highs of late despite a lack of overwhelming evidence that a years-long supply glut is close to ending. December Nymex and January Brent futures are both down 1.1% at $55.07 and $61.52/barrel, respectively, while December gasoline falls another 1.4% to $1.7374/gallon.

1829 ET - Communications Workers of America comes out late but strong backing AT&T 's takeover of Time Warner , continuing a trend of blessing the telecom company's M&A moves. Union president Chris Shelton says the deal gives "much-needed new competition to companies like Google , Facebook , and Amazon , where working people don't have union representation," echoing executives' arguments for why Justice Department antitrust officials should back off. It's not all buddy-buddy, though, as CWA negotiations over a new wireless workers' contract drags into its ninth month. AT&T employed more than 250K workers at the end of September, many of them unionized. (andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com; @drewfitzgerald)

1800 ET - New Trump Administration policy changes partly restricting US tourism in Cuba led to the latest discontinuation of airline flights. Alaska Air says it'll drop a daily flight linking Los Angeles and Havana on Jan. 22. Alaska said 80% of its fliers visited under a US allowance for individual "people-to-people" educational travel, which is no longer allowed. Low-fare Sun Country Airlines recently relinquished its rights to serve Santa Clara and Matanzas, Cuba, from Minneapolis. Spirit Airlines and Silver Airways already abandoned Cuba flights and American Airlines earlier trimmed its daily flights to the island nation to 10 from 13 and will drop a flight to Cienfuegos from Miami in January. More schedule changes could occur as airlines absorb the new rules, which also put 80 Cuban hotels off limits to Americans. (susan.carey@wsj.com)

1716 ET - After penning a series of letters asking the Trump administration to take heed of the US farm sector's heavy reliance on Nafta to underpin food exports, farm groups and major agricultural companies are turning to state governors for help. A letter sent Thursday to the top executive offices of all 50 states asks for governors' help to "let President Trump know" that states support modernizing the trade pact, not scrapping it, and to let negotiations continue "without the threat of withdrawal." The letter, signed by groups representing farmers and ranchers as well as agribusiness companies like ADM, Cargill and Smithfield Foods , comes after Trump has threatened to withdraw from Nafta, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has said Trump is "not a bluffer."

1700 ET - United Continental reaped a huge PR boost after it let passengers fly on its last 747 flight from San Francisco to Honolulu last week.

1648 ET - Don't expect Verizon to rush out and spend billions of dollars on licenses for wireless airwaves. During a meeting with reporters at a network facility in New Jersey, a top Verizon network executive said he is quite happy with the airwaves the carrier currently owns. The move to unlimited data plans hasn't crushed the network, he says, largely because Verizon has gotten so good at adding new cell sites while shrinking the coverage footprint of each one, meaning fewer customers attach to each. "We are going to be in fine shape capacity wise," says Mike Haberman, a top network official. "That is not something I wake up and worry about--that I'm going to run out of capacity."
