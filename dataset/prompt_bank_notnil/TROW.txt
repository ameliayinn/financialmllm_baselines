He highlights stocks that sold off after earnings on what he believes are temporary issues, creating a good buying opportunity. His list is: Ball Corp. ( BLL), Booz Allen Hamilton ( BAH), CA, Inc. ( CA), Chevron ( CVX), Freeport-McMoRan ( FCX), Gilead Sciences ( GILD), International Paper ( IP), Mattel ( MAT), Newell Brands ( NWL), and T. Rowe Price ( TROW), all of which have Buy ratings from his firm.

More from his note:

While investors may have sold these stocks because of what happened at the end of 2016, several of the stocks that have been identified are likely to benefit in the future from tax reform, according to Jefferies analysts, even if there's a Border Adjusted Tax. Beneficiaries of tax reform include Booz Allen Hamilton, CA, Inc., International Paper, and T. Rowe Price. Gilead already has a low tax rate, but the company would benefit from a lower tax rate on repatriated cash, with 80% of the company's cash held overseas.

That said, he notes that while not all stocks may benefit from tax reform, which remains uncertain, all do look like they've sold off too far since earnings.
