Pfizer's (PFE) announcement comes a bit more than a week after it initially said the efficacy rate was 90%. Moderna (MRNA) said Monday its Covid-19 vaccine has shown a 94.5% efficacy rate. Pfizer and BioNtech (BNTX) stock rose 0.8% and 4%, respectively, Wednesday. Moderna stock fell 4.6%.

"The market has definitely priced in a vaccine," Kenny Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors, told Barron's. "It's clear that between Pfizer and Moderna we're getting something." Between Pfizer and Moderna, 2 billion doses could be distributed by in 2021. Polcari added that the market may need other vaccine makers to report positive surprises, moving them closer to approval from the Food and Drug Administration in order for stocks to see another jolt upwards.

Another negative: economic data are decelerating. Credit-card spending has been running 7% below pre-pandemic levels in the past few weeks, according to Citigroup economists. That's worse than the 5% summer slump.

Against these headwinds, stocks have already surged. Since Nov. 6, the last day of trading before the recent pleasant vaccine surprises, the S&P 500 is up almost 2%, with value stocks, which are more economically sensitive than growth stocks are, outperforming. The S&P 500 Vanguard Value ETF (VOOV) is up a bit more than 6% since Nov. 6, as investors priced in the vaccine news. Plus, 84% of S&P 500 components entered Wednesday trading above their 50-day moving averages, which calls for a pause in the rally, Canaccord Genuity chief market strategist Tony Dwyer wrote in a note.

Still, it wasn't all risk-off in Wednesday's trading. The price of crude oil rose 0.5% to $41.65 a barrel. Treasury yields climbed slightly.

Home-builder stocks performed well, with Lennar (LEN) rose 1% and Toll Brothers (TOL) rose 0.8%. Housing starts in October ran at an annualized rate of 1.53 million, beating estimates of 1.46 million and rising 4.9% year-over-year. A range of indicators, including today's starts and permits, show housing is likely to remain one of the strongest sectors of the economy for some months to come," wrote Citigroup economists in a note. "Later in 2021 we expect housing activity to remain robust, but probably decline somewhat from currently elevated levels." Plus, interest rates only ticked up marginally Wednesday, with the 30-year fixed mortgage rate still a touch below 3%. Low rates encourage home buyers to borrow against a house.

Retailers were a mixed bag. Target (TGT) rose 2.4% after beating revenue and earnings estimates by a wide margin. But Lowe's (LOW) beat, too, and shares tumbled wider than 8%, the worst-performing component in the S&P 500. TJX (TJX) stock rose 1.9% after beating revenue and earnings estimates.

For the holiday season, "any sign that spending was more robust than expected could be a positive catalyst," Lindsey Bell, chief market strategist at Ally Invest, told Barron's.

Stocks needed a breather, but there are several catalysts for another leg up.
