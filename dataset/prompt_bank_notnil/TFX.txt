WAYNE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 02, 2017-- 

Teleflex Incorporated (NYSE: TFX) (the "Company") today announced financial results for the third quarter ended October 1, 2017.

Third quarter 2017 net revenues were $534.7 million, an increase of 17.4% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, third quarter 2017 net revenues increased 15.4% over the year ago period.

Third quarter 2017 GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 21.4% to $1.70, as compared to $1.40 in the prior year period. Third quarter 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 17.8% to $2.12, compared to $1.80 in the prior year period.

"Building upon our performance in the first half of the year, during the third quarter of 2017 Teleflex executed well, delivering 17.4% GAAP and 15.4% constant currency revenue growth, significant operating margin expansion, and GAAP and adjusted earnings per share that respectively increased 21.4% and 17.8% over the prior year period," said Benson Smith , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "In addition, despite having to deal with certain weather-related delays during the third quarter, Teleflex saw an acceleration in its organic revenue growth rate from the levels achieved earlier this year, thanks in part to progress made in our distributor to direct conversion in Asia."

Added Mr. Smith, "Finally, on the first day of the fourth quarter we completed the acquisition of NeoTract. This acquisition, coupled with revenue and non-revenue dependent opportunities within our base business, positions Teleflex to succeed for several years in the future."

2017 OUTLOOK

The Company raised its full year 2017 GAAP revenue growth guidance range from 11.5% to 13.0% to a range of 15.0% to 15.5% over the prior year. The Company's previous 2017 GAAP revenue growth guidance range reflected an anticipated 1.0% unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, while the Company's revised 2017 GAAP revenue growth guidance range reflects an anticipated 0.75% favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, the Company raised its full year 2017 guidance range from 12.5% to 14.0% to a range of 14.25% to 14.75% over the prior year. The forecasted GAAP and constant currency revenue growth guidance reflect the impact of Vascular Solutions ' product sales, which are expected to contribute approximately 8.5%, as compared to our prior expectations of 8.5% to 9%, and the impact of NeoTract's product sales, which are expected to contribute approximately 1.5% to 1.7%.

The Company lowered its full year 2017 GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance from a range of $5.91 to $5.98 to a range of $5.61 to $5.66. The decrease in expected full year 2017 GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance from prior expectations is primarily due to anticipated costs associated with the acquisition of NeoTract. The Company raised its full year 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance from a range of $8.20 to $8.35 to a range of $8.30 to $8.40.

CONFERENCE CALL WEBCAST AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

As previously announced, Teleflex will comment on its financial results on a conference call to be held today at 8:00 a.m. (ET). The call will be available live and archived on the company's website at www.teleflex.com and the accompanying presentation will be posted prior to the call. An audio replay will be available until November 8, 2017 at 11:59pm (ET), by calling 855-859-2056 (U.S./Canada) or 404-537-3406 (International), Passcode: 3479079.

ADDITIONAL NOTES

References in this release to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on adjusted diluted earnings per share include both the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on foreign currency denominated transactions.

In the discussion of segment results, "new products" refers to products we have sold commercially within the past 36 months and "existing products" refers to products we have sold commercially for more than 36 months.

Certain financial information is presented on a rounded basis, which may cause minor differences.

Segment results and commentary exclude the impact of discontinued operations.

NOTES ON NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

We report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, commonly referred to as "GAAP." In this press release, we provide supplemental information, consisting of the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted diluted earnings per share and constant currency revenue growth. These non-GAAP measures are described in more detail below. Management uses these financial measures to assess Teleflex 's financial performance, make operating decisions, allocate financial resources, provide guidance on possible future results, and assist in its evaluation of period-to-period and peer comparisons. The non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors because they provide insight into management's assessment of our business, and provide supplemental information pertinent to a comparison of period-to-period results of our ongoing operations. The non-GAAP financial measures are presented in addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Moreover, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Tables reconciling historical GAAP diluted earnings per share to historical adjusted diluted earnings per share are set forth below. A table reconciling changes in historical GAAP net revenues to changes in historical constant currency net revenues is set forth above under "Third Quarter Net Revenue by Segment". Tables reconciling forecasted 2017 constant currency revenue growth and forecasted 2017 adjusted earnings per share to their respective most directly comparable forecasted GAAP measures, forecasted 2017 revenue growth and forecasted 2017 diluted earnings per share available to common stockholders, are set forth above under "2017 Outlook".

Adjusted diluted earnings per share: This non-GAAP measure is based upon diluted earnings per share available to common stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, adjusted to exclude, depending on the period presented, the impact (net of tax) of (i) restructuring, restructuring related and impairment items; (ii) acquisition, integration and divestiture related items; (iii) other items identified in note (C) to the reconciliation tables set forth below; (iv) amortization of debt discount on convertible notes; (v) intangible amortization expense; (vi) loss on extinguishment of debt and (vii) tax adjustments. Management does not believe that any of the excluded items are indicative of our underlying core performance or business trends.

In addition, the calculation of the weighted average number of diluted shares within adjusted earnings per share gives effect to the anti-dilutive impact of shares due to the Company under its previously outstanding convertible note hedge agreements. The convertible note hedge agreements reduced the potential economic dilution that otherwise would have occurred upon conversion of the Company's senior subordinated convertible notes (under GAAP, the anti-dilutive impact of the convertible note hedge agreements was not reflected in the weighted average number of diluted shares). We believe that an adjustment to show the anti-dilutive effect of the convertible note hedge agreements provides supplemental information that can be useful to investors in assessing the computation of diluted earnings per share.

Constant currency revenue growth: This non-GAAP measure is based upon net revenues, adjusted to eliminate the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from period to period. The impact of changes in foreign currency may vary significantly from period to period, and generally are outside of the control of our management. We believe that this measure facilitates a comparison of our operating performance exclusive of fluctuations that do not reflect our underlying performance or business trends. 


 
 
RECONCILIATION OF CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME ITEMS 
Dollars in millions, except per share amounts 
 
The following reconciliation tables reflect a change in the classification of 
certain adjustment items from those presented in reconciliation tables 
included in our previous earnings releases. Specifically, we created a new 
line item titled "acquisition, integration and divestiture related items." The 
components of this new line item were formerly included in "losses and other 
charges, net." Additionally, we have included a new line item titled 
"restructuring, restructuring related and impairment items," which combines 
restructuring related items, which previously were included in "losses and 
other charges, net," with restructuring charges and other impairment items, 
which previously were included in "restructuring and other impairment 
charges." The prior periods presented in the following reconciliation tables 
and related materials were reclassified to conform to the current 
presentation.

(A) Restructuring, restructuring related and impairment items - Restructuring programs involve discrete initiatives designed to, among other things, consolidate or relocate manufacturing, administrative and other facilities, improve operating efficiencies and integrate acquired businesses. Our restructuring charges consist of termination benefits, contract termination costs, facility closure costs and other exit costs associated with a specific restructuring program. Restructuring related charges are directly related to our restructuring programs and consist of facility consolidation costs, including accelerated depreciation expense related to facility closures, costs to transfer manufacturing operations between locations, and retention bonuses offered to certain employees as an incentive for them to remain with our company after completion of the restructuring program. For the three months ended October 1, 2017 and September 25, 2016, pre-tax restructuring related charges were $3.1 million and $4.4 million, respectively.

(B) Acquisition, integration and divestiture related items - Acquisition and integration expenses are incremental costs, other than restructuring or restructuring related expenses, that are directly related to specific business or asset acquisition transactions. These costs may include, among other things, professional, consulting and other fees; systems integration costs; legal entity restructuring expense; inventory step-up amortization (amortization, through cost of goods sold, of the increase in fair value of inventory resulting from a fair value calculation as of the acquisition date); fair value adjustments to contingent consideration; and bridge loan facility and backstop financing fees in connection with facilities that ultimately were not utilized. For the three months ended October 1, 2017, the majority of these costs were related to our acquisition of Vascular Solutions . Divestiture related activities involve specific business or asset sales. Depending primarily on the terms of the divestiture transaction, the carrying value of the divested business or assets on our financial statements and other costs we incur as a direct result of the divestiture transaction, we may recognize a gain or loss in connection with the divestiture related activities.

(C) Other items - These are discrete items that occur sporadically and can affect period-to-period comparisons. For the three months ended October 1, 2017, these items included both gains and losses associated with litigation settlements.

(D) Amortization of debt discount on convertible notes - When we sold $400 million principal amount of our 3.875% convertible notes (the "convertible notes") in 2010, we allocated the proceeds between the liability and equity components of the debt, in accordance with GAAP. As a result, the $83.7 million difference between the proceeds of the sale of the convertible notes and the liability component of the debt constituted a debt discount that was to be amortized to interest expense over the approximately seven year term of the convertible notes, which significantly increased the amount we recorded as interest expense attributable to the convertible notes. The amount of the amortization of the debt discount was reduced as a result of our repurchases of convertible notes in 2016 and 2017 and redemptions of the convertible notes by holders of the notes, although we continued to amortize the remaining portion of the debt discount to interest expense until August 2017, when all remaining convertible notes were either converted or matured.

(E) Intangible amortization expense - Certain intangible assets, including customer lists, intellectual property, distribution rights, trade names and non-competition agreements, initially are recorded at historical cost and then amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. The amount of such amortization can vary from period to period as a result of, among other things, business or asset acquisitions or dispositions.

(F) Loss on extinguishment of debt - In connection with debt refinancings, debt repayments, repurchases of convertible notes and redemptions of convertible notes, outstanding indebtedness is extinguished. These events, which have occurred from time to time on an irregular basis, have resulted in losses reflecting, among other things, unamortized debt issuance costs, as well as debt prepayment fees and premiums (including conversion premiums resulting from conversion of convertible securities).

(G) Tax adjustments - These adjustments represent the impact of the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations for prior year returns, the resolution of audits, the filing of amended returns with respect to prior tax years and/or tax law changes affecting our deferred tax liability.

(H) Adjusted diluted shares are calculated by giving effect to the anti-dilutive impact of the Company's convertible note hedge agreements, which reduced the potential economic dilution that otherwise would have occurred upon conversion of the Company's convertible notes. Under GAAP, the anti-dilutive impact of the convertible note hedge agreements is not reflected in the weighted average number of diluted shares. 


 
 
RECONCILIATION OF CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME ITEMS 
Dollars in millions, except per share amounts 
 
The following reconciliation tables reflect a change in the classification of 
certain adjustment items from those presented in reconciliation tables 
included in our previous earnings releases. Specifically, we created a new 
line item titled "acquisition, integration and divestiture related items." The 
components of this new line item were formerly included in "losses and other 
charges, net." Additionally, we have included a new line item titled 
"restructuring, restructuring related and impairment items," which combines 
restructuring related items, which previously were included in "losses and 
other charges, net," with restructuring charges and other impairment items, 
which previously were included in "restructuring and other impairment 
charges." The prior periods presented in the following reconciliation tables 
and related materials were reclassified to conform to the current 
presentation.

(A) Restructuring, restructuring related and impairment items - Restructuring programs involve discrete initiatives designed to, among other things, consolidate or relocate manufacturing, administrative and other facilities, improve operating efficiencies and integrate acquired businesses. Our restructuring charges consist of termination benefits, contract termination costs, facility closure costs and other exit costs associated with a specific restructuring program. Restructuring related charges are directly related to our restructuring programs and consist of facility consolidation costs, including accelerated depreciation expense related to facility closures, costs to transfer manufacturing operations between locations, and retention bonuses offered to certain employees as an incentive for them to remain with our company after completion of the restructuring program. For the nine months ended October 1, 2017 and September 25, 2016, pre-tax restructuring related charges were $10.1 million and $11.1 million.

(B) Acquisition, integration and divestiture related items - Acquisition and integration expenses are incremental costs, other than restructuring or restructuring related expenses, that are directly related to specific business or asset acquisition transactions. These costs may include, among other things, professional, consulting and other fees; systems integration costs; legal entity restructuring expense; inventory step-up amortization (amortization, through cost of goods sold, of the increase in fair value of inventory resulting from a fair value calculation as of the acquisition date); fair value adjustments to contingent consideration; and bridge loan facility and backstop financing fees in connection with facilities that ultimately were not utilized. For the nine months ended October 1, 2017, the majority of these costs were related to our acquisition of Vascular Solutions . Divestiture related activities involve specific business or asset sales. Depending primarily on the terms of the divestiture transaction, the carrying value of the divested business or assets on our financial statements and other costs we incur as a direct result of the divestiture transaction, we may recognize a gain or loss in connection with the divestiture related activities.

(C) Other items - These are discrete items that occur sporadically and can affect period-to-period comparisons. For the nine months ended October 1, 2017, these items included both gains and losses associated with litigation settlements.

(D) Amortization of debt discount on convertible notes - When we sold $400 million principal amount of our 3.875% convertible notes (the "convertible notes") in 2010, we allocated the proceeds between the liability and equity components of the debt, in accordance with GAAP. As a result, the $83.7 million difference between the proceeds of the sale of the convertible notes and the liability component of the debt constituted a debt discount that was to be amortized to interest expense over the approximately seven year term of the convertible notes, which significantly increased the amount we recorded as interest expense attributable to the convertible notes. The amount of the amortization of the debt discount was reduced as a result of our repurchases of convertible notes in 2016 and 2017 and redemptions of the convertible notes by holders of the notes, although we continued to amortize the remaining portion of the debt discount to interest expense until August 2017, when all remaining convertible notes were either converted or matured.

(E) Intangible amortization expense - Certain intangible assets, including customer lists, intellectual property, distribution rights, trade names and non-competition agreements, initially are recorded at historical cost and then amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. The amount of such amortization can vary from period to period as a result of, among other things, business or asset acquisitions or dispositions.

(F) Loss on extinguishment of debt - In connection with debt refinancings, debt repayments, repurchases of convertible notes and redemptions of convertible notes, outstanding indebtedness is extinguished. These events, which have occurred from time to time on an irregular basis, have resulted in losses reflecting, among other things, unamortized debt issuance costs, as well as debt prepayment fees and premiums (including conversion premiums resulting from conversion of convertible securities).

(G) Tax adjustments - These adjustments represent the impact of the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations for prior year returns, the resolution of audits, the filing of amended returns with respect to prior tax years and/or tax law changes affecting our deferred tax liability.

(H) Adjusted diluted shares are calculated by giving effect to the anti-dilutive impact of the Company's convertible note hedge agreements, which reduced the potential economic dilution that otherwise would have occurred upon conversion of the Company's convertible notes. Under GAAP, the anti-dilutive impact of the convertible note hedge agreements is not reflected in the weighted average number of diluted shares.
