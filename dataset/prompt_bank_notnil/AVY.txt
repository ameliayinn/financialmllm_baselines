Finance Chief

Nordstrom Inc. has hired Anne Bramman as chief financial officer, filling a role that was vacated when its former CFO retired earlier this month.

Ms. Bramman, 49 years old, announced her resignation from Avery Dennison Corp., a maker of adhesive technologies and packaging materials, in March after two years on the job.

Nordstrom's former CFO, Mike Koppel, retired May 1 after 16 years with the company. He will continue to serve as an adviser through the end of the year.

Like other retailers, Nordstrom has been struggling to adapt to changing consumer behavior as more shopping shifts online. The company has weathered the changes better than some peers, in part because it moved quickly to buy digital startups such as Trunk Club and expand its off-price chain, called Nordstrom Rack.

Nevertheless, profit tumbled 41% to $354 million for the financial year ended in January, while sales inched up nearly 3% to $14.5 billion.

ROYAL DUTCH SHELL

Higher Oil Prices

Help Boost Profit

Royal Dutch Shell PLC on Thursday capped a bumper set of results for the world's biggest oil companies with its highest quarterly profit since mid-2015, as a fragile oil-price recovery and years of cost-cutting buoyed crude producers.

Shell said its first-quarter profit more than quadrupled from a year earlier to $3.4 billion. Quarter-on-quarter, the company saw higher earnings in all business segments.

Statoil reported net first-quarter earnings of $1.06 billion, up from $611 million a year earlier.

ARCONIC

Directors Named

Ahead of Vote

Arconic Inc. added two aerospace experts to its board Thursday ahead of a shareholder vote later this month when activist investor Elliott Management Corp. will seek to oust four directors.

Weeks after the ouster of Chairman and Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld over a letter he wrote to Elliott's founder, the aerospace and automotive parts maker has named former Boeing Co. executive James F. Albaugh and Janet C. Wolfenbarger, a retired Air Force four-star general, to its board.

Ratan Tata, of the famed Indian conglomerate family, will step down from Arconic's board, keeping it at 13 members.

Elliott is running a slate of four nominees and has argued the board needs more new faces, even after Mr. Kleinfeld's exit.

AIR FRANCE-KLM

Loss Grows Wider

On Strong Dollar

Air France-KLM SA on Thursday reported a larger first-quarter operating loss, weighed down by the strong dollar even as the airline group said bookings in its long-haul sector for the coming months were running ahead of last year's level.

The airline group posted a 216 million euros ($235 million) net loss for the January through March period, or 61 million euros worse than the prior year.

The more closely watched operating loss deteriorated by 44% to 143 million euros.
