LAS VEGAS, Dec. 26, 2017

LAS VEGAS, Dec. 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- GB Sciences, Inc . (OTCQB: GBLX) will be represented on the Medical Cannabis in Neuroscience Panel at The Neuroscience Innovation Forum for BD&L and Investment in Therapeutics and Technology to take place at the Marines' Memorial Club, San Francisco, on the 7th of January 2018. The event is held the day before the J.P. Morgan meeting, which provides an ideal opportunity for established pharmaceutical industry giants like AbbVie , Boehringer Ingelheim , Pfizer , Sanofi , Novartis , Merck, Eli Lilly , Johnson & Johnson , and Takeda to share their latest innovations in neuroscience therapeutics with their colleagues and the investment community; refer to link at: http://www.sachsforum.com/nif-about.html .

Dr. Andrea Small-Howard , Chief Science Officer, will serve on the Medical Cannabis in Neuroscience Panel on behalf of GB Sciences to discuss the opportunities and challenges of neuroscience product development in the cannabis biotech industry. GB Sciences has previously announced the development of its proprietary cannabis-based therapy for Parkinson's disease, which will begin first-in-human testing in 2018.

"GB Sciences is honored to join representatives from Tilray , Aurora Cannabis , and Emerald Therapeutics in a discussion of new cannabis-based therapeutic options for patients with neurodegenerative conditions. For example, GB Sciences has developed a novel Parkinson's formulation, which leverages molecular synergies among multiple plant-derived active ingredients to increase its efficacy," explains Dr. Small-Howard. "In the US, significant advances in research, such as this, would not be possible without access to cannabis and standardized cannabis extracts through state regulated cannabis programs; however, GB Sciences and other US cannabis biotech companies face significant hurdles at the Federal level in bringing these plant-based compounds through the traditional pharmaceutical pipeline. By contrast, Canada, where my fellow panel members do business, has a national cannabis program that creates a very different regulatory framework for product development in this field."

The prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders in society is growing as the population ages, yet there are few effective medications available to treat these debilitating brain disorders. Neurogenerative conditions add over $500 billion to the healthcare burden in the US each year, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. Representatives of the Michael J. Fox Foundation and other patient advocacy groups are also participating in the Neuroscience Innovation Forum.

"GB Sciences is one of the small number of cannabis-based biotech companies that are committed to developing novel therapeutics for neurodegenerative patients despite the current challenges of being a US-based cannabis enterprise. Our participation in the cannabis industry is the key factor enabling us to provide Parkinson's patients with safe access to effective medications sooner than through traditional pharmaceutical pipelines," explains John Poss, Chairman and CEO of GB Sciences, Inc.
