Ensign Energy Services Inc . ("Ensign" or "the Company") (TSX: ESI) announces a 2018 capital expenditure plan of $64 million, comprised of $43 million for capital maintenance on the fleet and $21 million of equipment and optimization upgrades to the current fleet.

Ensign's capital plan focuses on the continuation of appropriate certification and preventative maintenance of its high spec fleet in addition to the selective addition of higher capacity pumps, high torque top drive upgrades, and enhanced "Ensign Edge" drilling optimization systems in order to service the long reach lateral horizontal market and enhance margins.

We project the 2017 net capital expenditures to be approximately $105 million, which included delivery of two (2) new build drilling rigs (1 ADR-1500, 1 ADR-850), one new well servicing rig destined for the Permian basin, and major upgrades to two (2) 1500 HP rigs into super-spec ADR-1500's, also for the long reach horizontal Permian area.

The Company is also pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Gary Casswell to its Board of Directors, effective December 4, 2017.

His industry career most recently included tenure as the President & Chief Executive Officer of Northern Offshore Ltd ., a Bermuda-based offshore drilling company, listed on the Oslo exchange, with offshore rigs used in both benign and harsh environments worldwide. Prior to that, Mr. Casswell acted as the Vice President of Eastern Hemisphere Operations for Pride International, a Houston, Texas based drilling company that was acquired by Ensco plc in 2011. Mr. Casswell has lived and worked extensively throughout the Middle East, including in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Oman, and has extensive experience in the United States land drilling market.
