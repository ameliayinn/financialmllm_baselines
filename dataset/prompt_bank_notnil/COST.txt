1832 ET - Oracle cautions the tax bill could affect guidance in the current quarter. The pending tax overhaul in Washington left Oracle to caution analysts its guidance for the current quarter might be off. During a conference call with analysts discussing the company's fiscal second-quarter results, co-CEO Safra Catz says the business-software maker expects an adjusted tax rate "somewhere around 24%" in the fiscal third quarter. But then she offers the caveat that "with the current and very real possibility of tax reform, the Q3 tax rate could easily end up being very different, especially to the extent that there is repatriation." That's because Oracle could pay taxes on cash it brings to the US from overseas stashes, something Catz says the company would need to include in the quarter that the tax law changes. "I'm not sure that the final rate has been set and whether it will actually even stay in the bill." (jay.greene@wsj.com; @greene)

1825 ET - A proposed rule allowing small drones to routinely fly over people, and a separate proposal aimed at reducing space debris stemming from spent rockets, are the top 2018 regulatory priorities for the Federal Aviation Administration . The White House's latest unified regulatory agenda indicates the agency seeks to allow commercial drone operations over people "without a waiver or exemption." Another front-burner FAA issue will be releasing an advanced notice of proposals to establish broad security and law-enforcement safeguards for various types of drone applications. In addition, FAA officials are expected to propose a rule tightening oversight of disposal of upper-stages of spent rockets in space. (andy.pasztor@wsj.com)

1820 ET - The 61,600 jobs created in Australia in November has given Macquarie a sense of deja vu. The monthly gain means 361,000 jobs have been added already this year, an "exceptional" outcome that suggests it may be due for a pullback, the investment bank says. "The sharp swings in jobs growth over the past two years is reminiscent of the 2003-05 period which eventually saw a sharp slowing in jobs growth (at least temporarily)," Macquarie says. Still, it thinks jobs growth will remain pretty healthy in 2018 overall, even if an abrupt slowdown in the near term is a rising risk. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

1805 EST [Dow Jones ] -- The U.S. solar industry continues to have an off year thanks to rising solar prices and uncertainty over whether the Trump administration will impose tariffs or other trade protections on imported solar panels and cells. Solar power installations in the U.S. are down 22% year-to-date, even as more than 2 gigawatts of solar capacity were installed in the third quarter, according to GTM Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association. The capacity additions in Q3 represented a 51% drop year-over-year. President Trump faces a January deadline regarding the trade protections. (erin.ailworth@wsj.com; @ailworth)

1806 ET - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission clarifies that it hasn't dropped its effort to tighten supervision of high-frequency trading firms, but that it had moved its next action deadline for the rulemaking to December 2018. The Office of Management and Budget and Government Accountability Office , which compiles the federal government's unified regulatory agenda, categorizes that deadline as "long term action," leading it to be excluded from its semi-annual report on Thursday. Still, no movement on the regulation is expected in the near term, given the concerns of Republican CFTC members. (gabriel.rubin@wsj.com; @rubinations)

1802 EST [Dow Jones ] -- Wells Fargo predicts credit-rating agencies will downgrade Teva. The agencies are likely to issue downgrades after meeting with Teva's new CEO Kare Schultz next week, Wells Fargo says in a note to investors on Thursday. "We base this on both Teva's credit/leverage profile" as well as several other factors, including competition to top-selling product Copaxone and management turnover. Earlier in the day, Moody's Investors Service says it placed Teva's Baa3 senior unsecured ratings under review for a downgrade. Wells Fargo says Teva's North America generics chief Andy Boyer resigned Thursday and will leave the company in the first quarter. "With a new outsider CEO with no experience in the generic drug industry, allowing or asking those with deep industry and regulatory ties to leave may be ill-timed," Wells Fargo says.

1756 ET - The future of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces remains uncertain as this year's open enrollment period draws to a close Friday, with Republicans in Congress close to repealing the law's individual insurance mandate as part of a broader tax package. But the marketplaces may be filling a niche for the ranks of self-employed people who get work through companies such as Uber. Stride, a startup that focuses on health coverage for self-employed people, says a growing number of companies tied to such independent workers are promoting its services, most recently a half-dozen new ones including Fiverr, HoneyBook and Samaschool. Uber, Etsy , Instacart , DoorDash and others were already working with Stride, the company says. (anna.mathews@wsj.com; @annawmathews)

1755 ET - Kate Sampson, vice president of risk solutions at Lyft, says she expected insurance companies to be eager to use Lyft's driving data to improve their commercial auto insurance policies. But "even with 6 billion miles of data...we still can't find insurance companies willing to partner with us and leave their historical, biased underwriting procedures," she says at an insurance industry conference. "I can't tell you how many times I hear, 'If only you had 20 years of data.'" (Nicole.friedman@wsj.com, @NicoleFriedman)

1750 ET - Activist investor Elliott Management is gearing up to potentially take another proxy fight to Hess Corp ., according to WSJ. The activist would be the second this week preparing to wage another war against a company it had previously settled with. On Monday, WSJ reported Carl Icahn was preparing for a second proxy fight with Xerox after reaching a settlement with the copy-machine maker in January of last year. Elliott, now seeking an ouster of Hess CEO John Hess , had settled with the company in 2013, stripping Hess of his chairmanship and adding its own board members. (nathan.becker@wsj.com; @natebecker)

1742 ET - Costco reports strong sales in existing stores, up 7.9% without gas, inflation or currency movement. The strong figure was helped by a surge in e-commerce sales up 42.1% in the fiscal first quarter. Costco added more food-shipping options to its site during the quarter, though online sales are still a small part of its revenue overall. Still, early data shows that Costco 's online sales grew faster than some competitors during the holiday season. According to Slice Intelligence Costco's online sales rose 60% since Nov. 1 compared to last year, a larger jump than any other retailers. Overall online spending since Nov. 1 is up 24%, the firm says. Costco gains 2.3% to $190.80 after hours. (sarah.nassauer@wsj.com)
