NEW HYDE PARK, N.Y., Dec. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Northwell Health and Cigna have reached agreement to continue their more than 20-year relationship, keeping all Northwell hospitals, physicians, laboratories, home health and other providers in the Cigna network.

On November 30, Cigna preemptively notified its members that Northwell was leaving the Cigna hospital network, but an agreement has been reached to continue the longstanding participation agreement. Members and employers should disregard any communication from Cigna or others stating that Northwell providers will not participate with Cigna Health Plans. The agreement will continue without change through 2018 and all Northwell patients who are insured through Cigna will continue to be welcomed and cared for by Northwell providers.

"Northwell puts its patients first to ensure that all patients receive the medical care they need," said Howard Gold , executive vice president, and chief managed care officer. "We regret any confusion or inconvenience caused by Cigna 's letter."
