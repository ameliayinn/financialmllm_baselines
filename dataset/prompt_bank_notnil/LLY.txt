INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 5, 2020

INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 5, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Loxo Oncology at Lilly, a research and development group of Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY), today announced that study investigators will present data from the LOXO-305 development program at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting to be held December 5-8, 2020. LOXO-305 is an investigational, highly selective, non-covalent Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor.

The LOXO-305 oral presentations will provide updated clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 BRUIN clinical trial in previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, and other non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The submitted abstracts utilized an April 2020 data cut-off date, and the presentations will utilize a September 2020 data cut-off date.

Additionally, a pre-clinical analysis of LOXO-305 alone and in combination with venetoclax, rituximab, R-CHOP or obinutuzumab will be presented in a poster presentation.

The schedule for the oral and poster presentations are as follows:

About LOXO-305

LOXO-305 is an investigational, oral, highly selective, non-covalent Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. BTK plays a key role in the B-cell antigen receptor signaling pathway, which is required for the development, activation and survival of normal white blood cells, known as B-cells, and malignant B-cells. BTK is a validated molecular target found across numerous B-cell leukemias and lymphomas including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, and marginal zone lymphoma. Currently available BTK inhibitors irreversibly inhibit BTK and the long-term efficacy of these therapies can be limited by acquired resistance, most commonly through BTK C481 mutations. In rapidly growing tumors with inherently high rates of BTK turnover, resistance to covalent BTK therapies may be the result of incomplete target inhibition. LOXO-305 was designed to reversibly bind BTK, deliver consistently high target coverage regardless of BTK turnover rate, preserve activity in the presence of the C481 acquired resistance mutations, and avoid off-target kinases that have complicated the development of both covalent and investigational non-covalent BTK inhibitors. Interested patients and physicians can contact the Loxo Oncology at Lilly Physician and Patient BTK Clinical Trial Hotline at 1-855-LOXO-305 or email clinicaltrials@loxooncology.com.

About the BRUIN Trial

This first-in-human, global, multi-center Phase 1/2 trial evaluates LOXO-305 as a single agent in patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), or non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL ). The primary objective of the Phase 1 portion of the trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose or recommended Phase 2 dose. Key secondary objectives include measures of safety, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity (i.e. Overall Response Rate and Duration of Response, as determined by appropriate histology-specific response criteria). The trial includes a Phase 1 dose escalation phase and a Phase 2 dose expansion phase. The Phase 1 dose escalation enrolls patients with CLL/SLL or NHL who have received at least two prior lines of therapy and have progressed or are intolerant to standard of care. In the Phase 2 dose expansion phase, patients are enrolled across various cohorts, depending on disease type and prior therapy.
