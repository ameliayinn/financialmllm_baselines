1625 ET - The quality of the US corn crop, beset by early weather troubles, held steady last week as farmers in the western Corn Belt began harvesting. The USDA says 61% of the crop was in good-or-excellent condition as of Sunday, unchanged from a week earlier. Farmers have collected 5% of the crop, with the most rapid progress in Texas and Nebraska. The share of good-or-excellent soybeans, meanwhile, dipped to 60% from 61% a week earlier. That the quality of both crops is largely steady adds to the mounting evidence that the US is on track for another large harvest this season. (benjamin.parkin@wsj.com; @b_parkyn)

1618 ET - Though the poultry industry for years has sought to run its processing lines faster than the USDA currently allows, it would likely take time for it to ramp up if the current cap is raised. Sanderson Farms (SAFM) CEO Joe Sanderson told investors on a conference call in May that chicken companies would first need to build up their breeder flocks to supply enough birds to fulfill the additional processing capacity, while also adding hatchery space and modifying plant operations to accommodate the faster speeds. "It would take a year to do that," Sanderson said at the time. (jacob.bunge@wsj.com; @jacobbunge)

1605 ET - US stocks post strong gains and the S&P 500 closes at an all-time high as worries over North Korea and Hurricane Irma lessen. The Dow rises 1.2% to 22057, the S&P gains 1.1% to 2488 and the Nasdaq adds 1.1% to 6432. Financials top the S&P and insurers lead that sector higher as hurricane-battered stocks XL Group and Everest Re rebound as Irma's intensity fades and worst case scenarios didn't come to pass, gaining 5% and 4.3% respectively. Only telecom was lower, with CenturyLink down 1.1%. Equifax was by far the hardest-hit S&P company, down 8.2% as it continues to plummet after announcing it was hacked. Haven assets pull back with gold 1.5% lower at $1331 and 10-year Treasury yields rising to 2.131%. Oil rises 1.2% to $48.04. The WSJ Dollar Index jumps 0.7% as investors load up on dollars ahead of US economic data later this week. (jonathan.vuocolo@wsj.com; @jonvuocolo)

1547 ET - Bank of Canada issues comments taking issue with an assessment that it dropped the ball in telegraphing its outlook ahead of last week's decision to increase the policy rate. BMO Capital Markets' chief economist said there was an "epic fail" when it came to BoC communications before the Sept. 6 rate decision, and that's partly why C$ and Canada bond yields shot up dramatically. In contrast, the Federal Reserve goes to great lengths to address markets beforehand. BoC, through a spokesman, says traders had priced in "roughly 50-50 odds of an increase," prior to the announcement, versus the majority of economists who predicted no change. "A much higher percentage of trading desks were correctly interpreting the bank's prior messaging that monetary policy would be forward-looking and data dependent, not predetermined."

1543 ET - No 2 US chicken processor Pilgrim's Pride (PPC), majority owned by embattled Brazilian meatpacker JBS SA, agreed to buy European meat company Moy Park from JBS for $1B in a neat trick of portfolio management for JBS. Vertical Group analysts generally like the strategic aspects of the deal -- namely boosting Pilgrim's sales from higher-margin prepared foods -- but say it adds more uncertainties for previously North America-focused Pilgrim's. Retail is even more competitive in Europe than the US, Vertical says, and along with new regulatory and currency risks, animal production and processing tends to be more heavily regulated there. PPC falls 3.1%. (jacob.bunge@wsj.com; @jacobbunge)

1538 ET - Boeing (BA) takes its satellite order tally for 2017 to eight with the latest order for seven from Luxembourg-based SES, surpassing its tally for the previous three years combined. BA managed four orders last year, two in 2015 and one the previous year. The latest $1B deal for medium-earth-orbit satellites highlights the lack of commercial opportunities even as the industry touts the emergence of nanosats which can be launched and deployed by the hundred.

1513 ET - Hurricane Irma has shut down CSX headquarters in downtown Jacksonville, a spokesman for the railway says, and it will remain closed through Tuesday. Local authorities recommended businesses adjacent to waterways close, and the building is near the St. Johns River. Other area facilities remain open. CSX stopped shipments to parts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina last week and will start those back up once conditions allow. (paul.ziobro@wsj.com; @pziobro)

1452 ET - The travel unit of UK-based Allianz Insurance PLC says it is handling around 5,500 claims from customers whose trips were delayed or cancelled from Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. The storms, which swept through the Florida and Texas coasts "caused thousands of customers to cancel their trips," the insurer said, without giving a money figure for the claims.

1445 ET - Capital One chief executive Richard Fairbank said at the Barclays financial services conference that the Equifax breach is "going to be costly" to the bank, citing costs that will likely be associated with servicing, customer service calls and reissuing credit cards. He said the Equifax breach "is a different animal in terms of the information that's been breached. We have not been through the equivalent of this one." (annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com)

1443 ET - Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) CEO Meg Whitman has joined the board of directors at Dropbox, a highly-valued privately-held Silicon Valley startup that began as online storage for documents and photos. Dropbox is now worth an estimated $10B and is said to be eyeing an initial public offering later this year. The company has raised an eye-popping $607M in equity funding. Whitman is no stranger to the needs of tech startups going public. She joined EBAY in 1998 when it had just 30 employees and revenues of about $4M, and shepherded the company through an IPO in 2002. She ultimately helped build the company to $8B in annual revenue by 2008, the year she left EBAY. (rachael.king@wsj.com; @sfwriter)
