Yet the strategic logic driving big deals has only grown. Debt remains cheap, and paint producers have been caught this year between lackluster sales and spiraling raw-material costs. The savings available from combining purchasing budgets look more attractive than ever.

It is tempting to bet a deal will happen. Akzo used to be the obvious target, but now a takeover of Axalta looks more plausible.

Nippon's offer came in around $37 a share. This looks low. Last year industry leader Sherwin-Williams paid 14.2 times expected earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation for Valspar. Applying that multiple to Axalta's 2018 forecast Ebitda gives a share price of roughly $43.

Akzo's all-share offer for Axalta would have been worth more than $37 a share, but only assuming optimistic cost savings estimates of over $700 million. By comparison, Sherwin-Williams estimated only $280 million of savings through its combination with Valspar, which is roughly twice the size of Akzo-Axalta.

Not only do the savings look unrealistic, but extracting them would have been up to Akzo's new chief, who was slated to lead a combined entity, according to people familiar with the talks.

Shareholders, including activist Elliott Management, failed to bring Akzo's management into talks with PPG earlier this year; they might also fail to hold them to enforce those savings. It is hard to see why Axalta's investors, led by Berkshire Hathaway, would accept this governance downgrade.

That leaves the question of whether Nippon is prepared to pay more. Synergies could be up to $300 million, and combining big Japanese and U.S. automotive-paint players makes strategic sense. But Nippon has issued mixed messages about its appetite for the necessary leverage or equity dilution.

Axalta's stock languishes at roughly $32 -- up from about $28 before Akzo's interest became public in late October but well below a takeout price. Nothing is predictable in M&A, but there is probably enough chance that Axalta again becomes a target to justify a bet.
