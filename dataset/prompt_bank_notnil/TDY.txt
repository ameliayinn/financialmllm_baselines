operations 
 
   FREDERICTON, N.B., Nov. 25, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Teledyne  CARIS 
 https://www.teledynecaris.com/en/home/  , a Teledyne Technologies  
[NYSE:TDY] company, is pleased to announce significant funding from 
Canada's Ocean Supercluster award to develop software for remote 
operations survey processing. This is in alignment with the company's 
leading AI strategy. 
 
   Teledyne  CARIS' project aims at three targeted deliverables: 
 
 
   1. The enhancement of its desktop-based product line to leverage the cloud 
      to deliver consistent access for global users in every possible 
      circumstance 
 
   2. Support for remote mapping operations to underpin advancements in ocean 
      robotics 
 
   3. Infusing its passion for future ocean mappers with access to virtual 
      training through the CARIS Cloud Platform. 
 
 
   The company has partnered with Ocean Floor Geophysics (OFG), a 
pioneering CARIS customer with vast experience using the company's 
software with autonomous vehicles. This real-world experience (and 
location on Canada's West Coast) made them an ideal collaborator and 
provide a national perspective. 
 
   In addition to OFG, Teledyne  CARIS will be working with other 
stakeholders to assist on training, including the University of New 
Brunswick and Memorial Universities Marine Institute. Both universities 
offer CARIS software as part of their curriculum. Other stakeholders 
include CIDCO from Quebec and H2i, a consultancy from Ottawa 
specializing in Ocean Mapping strategy. 
 
   "We are excited to continue innovating in support of remote operations 
through the design and execution of the CARIS Cloud Program. 
Collaborating with Canada's Ocean Supercluster is something we have been 
keen to do and through the Accelerated Ocean Solutions Program we have 
found our platform. This project has special meaning to Teledyne  CARIS 
as a Canadian endeavor with a global impact," stated Andy Hoggarth, VP 
Sales and Marketing at Teledyne  CARIS.
