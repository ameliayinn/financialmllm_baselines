"It's very close to break-even now," Lenovo's chief executive, Yang Yuanqing , told The Wall Street Journal, after the firm posted earnings for its fiscal second quarter. Lenovo said its net profit jumped 53%, supported by the continued demand boom for personal computers amid rising digitization of work, education and entertainment since the coronavirus pandemic.
