Costs Further

Norfolk Southern Corp. posted a decline in revenue but notched higher profit in its fourth quarter as it cut costs, an effort it said it would continue as rival railway operators are pushed to take similar belt-tightening measures.

The Norfolk, Va., company Wednesday said it planned to cut $650 million in annual costs by 2020. Norfolk Southern cut $250 million in annual costs in 2016 and plans to cut $100 million more this year.

In all for the period, the company posted a profit of $416 million, or $1.42 a share, up from $361 million, or $1.20 a share, a year earlier. Revenue slipped 1.1% to $2.49 billion.

Norfolk Southern also said this week that it increased its quarterly dividend by 2 cents to 61 cents per share.

UNITED TECHNOLOGIES

Conglomerate Puts

Focus on Jet Engines

United Technologies Corp. said revenue was flat across its business units in the fourth quarter, as the company continues to troubleshoot issues with its newest line of jet engines and search for growth markets for its elevators and building-equipment businesses.

The Farmington, Conn., conglomerate reaffirmed its guidance for 2017. For now, much of the company's focus remains on the production of its new geared turbofan jet engine. The engine is a product on which its Pratt & Whitney unit has staked more than a decade and $10 billion of investment.

While revenue declined 1% in the company's Otis elevator unit, new equipment orders rose 3% on a constant currency basis.

In all for the quarter, United Technologies reported a profit of $1.01 billion, down from a profit of $3.28 billion in the same quarter in the previous year. On a per-share basis, the company posted earnings from continuing operations of $1.26, compared with a loss of 30 cents in the prior-year period. During the previous year's quarter, the company sold its Sikorsky helicopter unit to Lockheed Martin Corp. for $9 billion, affecting that quarter's profit and per-share earnings.

On an adjusted basis, the company reported earnings of $1.56 a share. Revenue grew 2.5% to $14.66 billion.

MATTEL

Weak Holidays

Weigh on Results

Mattel Inc. reported a sharp drop in profit and sales during its critical fourth quarter, as weak demand for toys during the holiday season forced it to resort to discounting to move unsold merchandise from store shelves.

The disappointing results come a week after the maker of Barbie dolls and Fisher-Price toys said it was hiring a Google executive, Margaret Georgiadis, to replace its Chief Executive Christopher Sinclair, who will step aside next month.

Mattel released its report a week ahead of schedule. The weak results surprised investors. Its shares fell 11% in late trading.

Fourth-quarter profit fell 19% to $173.8 million, or 50 cents a share, well below Wall Street's expectations. Global sales fell about 8% to $1.83 billion, hurt by the loss of the Disney Princess dolls business to rival Hasbro Inc. In North America, net sales fell 7%.
