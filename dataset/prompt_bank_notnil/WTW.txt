NEW YORK, Dec. 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Weight Watchers International, Inc . (NYSE: WTW) launches WW Freestyle, a new program that builds on the highly successful and effective SmartPoints(R) system by expanding zero Points foods from only fruits and vegetables to a list of more than 200 delicious, satisfying foods. In a six-month clinical trial, WW Freestyle produced better weight loss results among participants than in clinical trials of previous Weight Watchers programs(1) .

"When I first heard about it, I thought it was too good to be true -- the fish, beans and corn in my favorite tacos are now zero Points!" said Oprah Winfrey . "I thought the SmartPoints system was livable before, but Freestyle brings an even greater level of ease."

As always with Weight Watchers, every food and beverage is still on the menu, and now members have the freedom to eat many more foods without tracking or measuring, including eggs, corn, all fish, all seafood, skinless chicken breast, skinless turkey breast, non-fat plain yogurt, beans, peas, lentils and tofu. For even more flexibility, up to four unused SmartPoints each day automatically rollover for members to use as they wish on another day.

"For people to successfully lose weight and live healthier, simplicity and flexibility are key," said Gary Foster, Ph.D ., Chief Scientific Officer, Weight Watchers International, Inc. "The new Freestyle program offers a wide range of zero Points foods that guide members toward a healthier pattern of eating. It gives people the freedom and flexibility they need to make significant changes on and off the scale. The results are the best we've ever seen for a Weight Watchers program in a clinical trial."

In a six-month clinical trial of the WW Freestyle program, conducted at the University of North Carolina Weight Research Lab, participants experienced significant benefits both on and off the scale(1) : 


   -- Participants experienced an average weight loss of 7.9 percent after six 
      months 
 
   -- 93.6 percent of participants agreed WW Freestyle helps them feel 
      healthier 
 
   -- Participants reported significant reductions in food cravings and hunger 
 
   -- Among those who reported trying to lose weight in the past, 82.2 percent 
      of participants reported that WW Freestyle is easier to do and 92.6 
      percent reported that it gives them more flexibility in their food 
      choices compared to other times they've tried to lose weight in the past 

"We're constantly innovating to make our program even simpler and more livable," said Mindy Grossman , President and Chief Executive Officer, Weight Watchers International, Inc. "Freestyle is simple, freeing, and it delivers results. It helps you live your best life."
