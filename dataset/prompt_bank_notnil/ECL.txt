Ecolab Inc . ("Ecolab ") (NYSE: ECL) today announced results as of the expiration of the early participation period at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 30, 2017 (the "Early Participation Date"), of its offer ("Exchange Offer") to certain eligible holders to exchange its outstanding 5.500% Notes due 2041 (CUSIP 278865 AM2) (the "Old Notes") for up to $375 million aggregate principal amount (the "Exchange Cap") of its newly issued 3.950% Notes due 2047 ("New Notes"). The 3.950% Notes due 2047 being offered in the Exchange Offer will be a further issuance of, and will be in addition to, the 3.950% Notes due 2047 (the "Original 2047 Notes") Ecolab issued for cash on November 27, 2017, in the aggregate principal amount of $325 million.

The Exchange Offer is being conducted on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in a confidential offering memorandum dated November 16, 2017, and related letter of transmittal (together, the "Exchange Offer Documents").

The Total Exchange Consideration to be received in the Exchange Offer for each $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Early Participation Date is set forth in the table below. The Total Exchange Consideration will be rounded to the nearest cent per $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes and includes an amount of $50.00 per $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes tendered and accepted for exchange by Ecolab (the "Early Participation Amount"). Since the aggregate principal amount of Old Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Participation Date resulted in the Exchange Cap being exceeded, Old Notes tendered will be subject to the proration procedures described in the Exchange Offer Documents, there will be no Final Settlement Date with respect to the Exchange Offer, and no additional tenders of Old Notes will be accepted for purchase in the Exchange Offer after the Early Participation Date.

Although participants in the Exchange Offer will not hold New Notes prior to the applicable settlement date, the first interest payment on the New Notes will include the interest accrued from the issuance date of the Original 2047 Notes to the applicable settlement date. Further, each holder whose Old Notes are accepted for exchange will receive a cash payment (reduced as described in the following sentence) representing interest, if any, that has accrued from the most recent interest payment date in respect of the Old Notes up to, but not including, the applicable settlement date; provided, that, holders of Old Notes will not receive accrued and unpaid interest that is due and payable on the applicable settlement date if the accrued and unpaid interest that is due and payable on the applicable settlement date on the New Notes exceeds the accrued and unpaid interest that is payable on the applicable settlement date on the Old Notes. Interest payable on the Old Notes up to, but not including, the applicable settlement date will be reduced by the interest accrued on the New Notes up to, but not including, the applicable settlement date.
