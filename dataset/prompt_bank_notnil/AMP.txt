1054 ET - Tuesday's eye-popping news that Yahoo 's 2013 cybersecurity breach actually affected all of its 3B users, not the 1B originally disclosed, won't affect the terms of Verizon 's recent $4.5B purchase of Yahoo . A person familiar with the matter tells WSJ that Verizon assumed the 1B breach affected all of Yahoo 's users when it negotiated for a $350M discount off the initial $4.8B price tag. Yahoo 's entire user base has already been forced to reset their passwords, so victims won't need to take additional action. Verizon and Altaba, which sold Yahoo , share liability for consumer lawsuits and Altaba retains liability for government investigations. (ryan.knutson@wsj.com; @ryan_knutson)

1038 ET - Brazil's antitrust agency, Cade, expresses concern that Bayer AG 's proposed $57B takeover of Monsanto could lead to "significant" concentration in one of the world's largest markets for crop seeds. "With the acquisition of Monsanto , Bayer will become dominant in key parts of the chain of the main crops, strengthening the company's position in a worrisome way," Cade's general superintendent said in a technical report. The report was sent to Cade's full council, which has about five months to decide whether to approve the deal, block it, or say what must be done to address the concerns raised.

1027 ET - Monsanto executives say they remain upbeat about the fate of the company's flagship herbicide in Europe, despite signs of growing opposition. The EU is due to decide by mid-December on whether to renew its approval of the weedkiller glyphosate, after last year issuing a temporary extension amid fresh debate over the chemical's potential to cause cancer. France in September said it would vote against extending glyphosate's approval, drawing swift reprisals from European farmers, but Monsanto President Brett Begemann says on the company's 4Q conference call that "we remain optimistic," and that Monsanto anticipates glyphosate-- he world's most widely used herbicide--to be re-registered by the end of 2017.

1021 ET - While 85-90% of coffee export revenues go to Brazilian coffee growers, they receive only 10% of the overall industry profits, says the Programa Brasil da Plataforma Global do Cafe's Pedro Ronca at the Global Coffee Sustainability Conference in Geneva. By engaging the research establishment, exporters like Cecafe, and big agro-chemical companies like Syngenta , Bayer , and Dow Agroscience, the Brazilian coffee sector can move closer to the Global Coffee Platform target of 80% of production coming from small and medium-sized farms. Between 20% and 30% of the Brazilian coffee market currently follows sustainability guidelines, Mr. Ronca estimates. On a global level, "there is a long way to go," he says. "It takes time to build trust and relationships and understand mutual interests, but I still believe that co-operation is the best way to go forward," he adds. (david.hodari@wsj.com ; @davidhodari)

1016 ET - Pirelli's return to the stock market is rather disappointing, says Alessandro Allegri, head of Ambrosetti Asset Management Sim, but in the medium term the outlook is positive. "A degree of volatility is normal in the first days," Mr. Allegri says. "Moreover, the company returned to trading on a difficult day for the markets." However, in the medium and long term, the perspective appears positive for Pirelli, thanks to its focus on higher-margin products and its position in markets like China and South America. Pirelli trades down 1.4% at EUR6.44, while Italy's benchmark FTSE MIB index is down 1.3%. (pietro.lombardi@dowjones.com; @pietrolombard10)

0949 ET - Cedar Fair's president and COO will become its next CEO. The amusement-park operator says Richard Zimmerman will replace CEO Matt Ouimet Jan. 1, when Ouimet will assume the newly created role of executive chairman and Zimmerman will also join the board.

0939 ET - Wells Fargo says it's refunding certain customers who may have wrongfully paid fees for mortgage lock extensions. The bank gave additional details after its CEO Timothy Sloan mentioned the refunds during a Congressional hearing Tuesday. The bank says it will reach out to all home lending customers who paid fees for so-called mortgage rate lock extensions from September 16, 2013 through February 28, 2017, around 110,000, and refund customers who believe they shouldn't have paid those fees. The bank says it found its policy implemented in September 2013 wasn't always consistent and sometimes customers were charged fees when the bank was responsible for delays that necessitated extensions. Wells Fargo changed its policy in March 2017. Over the summer the bank disclosed that it was reviewing policies and procedures around mortgage rate lock extension fees following media reports and that the CFPB was investigating the matter.
