Two credit-card lenders, Capital One Financial and Discover Financial Services, reported lukewarm results on Tuesday. Shares of both fell on Wednesday against a broadly rising market.

Rewards costs are climbing as card issuers scramble to keep up with each other's cash back and travel point offers. At Discover, rewards costs rose 10.5% from a year earlier. The rate of rewards per dollar spent on its cards rose to 1.26% from 1.18% a year earlier.

Capital One doesn't break out rewards expenses in this way, instead netting them against the interchange fees it gets on every card swipe. But rewards pressure was visible here, too, as transaction fee revenue was basically flat despite a 10% rise in purchase volume.

Capital One Chief Executive Richard Fairbank warned on a conference call that the industry "has moved into the more intense part of the competitive cycle." Industrywide, growth in revolving debt balances has been running at about 7% a year, much faster than household incomes, he said. Subprime card loans are increasing even faster, at about 13%, he added.

Against this backdrop, Discover and Capital One both said they are staying disciplined in their lending practices. Defaults, which are already rising from historically low levels, are destined to head higher.

Shares of Capital One and Discover Financial have risen about 17% since the election. Now might be a good time for investors to take a breather.
