Friction between landlords and tenants usually centers on clauses that allow retailers to receive rent concessions if certain anchor tenants leave the mall or if occupancy levels fall below a certain threshold.

A recent court ruling granting a preliminary injunction to prevent Starbucks Corp. from closing Teavana stores in 77 retail locations owned by mall landlord Simon Property Group Inc. is causing more tenants to scrutinize lease contracts as concerns mount that they could end up in the same boat.

Some tenants, alarmed by the injunction, are demanding clauses in lease contracts that allow them to terminate early, said Corey Bialow, chief executive at Bialow Real Estate LLC, a firm that represents retail tenants.

Court filings show that the landlord's fear is that the departure of Teavana could result in a retail version of a bank run.

"Each premature closure is viewed by tenants as an indication of a larger possible problem with the mall retail environment and emboldens other tenants to approach Simon and ask to close some or all of their stores," according to court documents quoting testimony by Bruce Tobin, Simon's senior executive vice president of leasing malls.

Simon didn't respond to requests for additional comment. Starbucks didn't respond to requests for comment, but has said it was disappointed by the ruling.

The uncertainty over occupancy and leasing success in malls, strip centers and other retail properties is also driving disputes between lenders and landlords. In particular, some owners of properties that are more highly leveraged and funded with riskier debt face a greater threat of their property getting repossessed by lenders if the owners are unable to meet their debt obligations.

Activist investors also have been circling mall real-estate investment trusts, whose share prices have been sliding for the past year.

Taubman Centers Inc. has spent roughly $12 million in legal and advisory services fees in the first nine months this year on activities related to a shareholder activist campaign launched by Jonathan Litt. Meanwhile, Paul Singer's Elliott Management Corp., another firm known for agitating for change, recently took a stake in the luxury-mall operator. Taubman and Elliott declined to comment. Mr. Litt didn't respond to requests for comment.
