0739 GMT - Growth in the coming years will be slow but a global recession is not a base-case scenario, says William Davies , chief investment officer for EMEA and global head of equities at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. Speaking at a late Tuesday press event in Frankfurt, Davies said growth will be pressured by industry and capital investments, while inflation and interest rates will remain low. Recession can't be ruled out, but if it comes it will be mild, he says. Columbia Threadneedle's concern is that industrial problems start to hit employment, capital investment and eventually consumption, he adds.(emese.bartha@wsj.com)
