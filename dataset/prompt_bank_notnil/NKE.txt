Over half of Nike's revenue and even more of its growth comes from outside North America. The company says growth from other continents will contribute 75% of incremental growth over the next five years. It is particularly focused on China, its third-largest market after North America and Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Revenue in China grew 16% in the quarter, reaching $1.2 billion. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa it grew 19% to $2.1 billion.

Yet Nike's domestic business remains large, and it has become a large challenge as well. At its investors day in October, the company painted a multiyear trajectory of growth world-wide. It isn't clear, however, that it can fill the gap between where it is and where it says it will be.

"Investors are holding on for a long-term win, but there will come a point when you actually need to see those results," says Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst at Nomura Securities.

A company that once seemingly could do no wrong is in a rut. Nike has beaten analysts' consensus expectations in each of its last 10 earnings reports by an average of 16%, but the shares have still fallen meaningfully six of those times.

Nike encourages belief, and investors want to believe. If it doesn't start to deliver, that faith may sour further.
