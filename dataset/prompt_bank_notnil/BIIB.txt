Surging technology shares have helped the index outperform its peers so far this year. The top five contributors to the Nasdaq's 2017 gains -- Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. -- account for 41% of the index's advance, according to stock-market research firm Birinyi Associates.

Such gains have partly come at the expense of the bank and industrial shares that powered the postelection rally. Tech stocks have become a way to bet on U.S. economic growth while reducing reliance on anticipated U.S. policy changes like tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure spending, many investors and analysts say.

Technology shares in the S&P 500 have risen roughly 14% so far this year, compared with 2.5% for financials and 6.7% for the broader S&P 500. The Nasdaq Composite is up 12% year to date.

Fund managers bumped up overweight positions in the tech sector to the second-highest level in Bank of America Merrill Lynch data going back to 2008, the bank said in March.

"If the economy is going to heat up, you want to be in an area that can keep up," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist and senior portfolio manager at Boston Private Wealth.

Tech companies in the S&P 500 are on track to post 14% growth in earnings for the first quarter from the year-earlier period, according to reported results and analyst estimates on FactSet, compared with the 10% growth rate expected for the broader S&P 500.

Apple shares have risen 25% for the year on signs of renewed momentum at the firm. Apple in May is expected to report quarterly earnings of $2.02 a share, according to FactSet, up from $1.90 a share a year earlier.

Class A shares of Facebook have gained 27% in 2017, with analysts estimating the company will report quarterly earnings of $1.12 a share in May, according to FactSet, supported by data pointing to sustained growth in its advertising revenue. The firm had reported earnings of 52 cents a share a year earlier.

Amazon, Google's Alphabet and Intel Corp. are scheduled to report results on Thursday.
