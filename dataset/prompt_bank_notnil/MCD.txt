   This marks the first time McDonald's  has included the Happy Meal on a

crispy chicken filet made with all white meat served on a toasted bun 
with pickles and the recently introduced creamy, sweet and tangy

every chicken item McDonald's  serves in the United States, the chicken 
filet is made from chicken not treated with antibiotics important to 
human medicine***.
