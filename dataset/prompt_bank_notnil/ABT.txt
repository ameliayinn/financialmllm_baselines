1226 ET - Medical-device maker Edwards Lifesciences is likely to continue to dominate the growing market for replacement heart valves known as TAVR, but the company may need new avenues of growth to support a hefty stock-price valuation, Jefferies says. "While TAVR is still growing at a healthy 20%, EW's trajectory is slowing as its base gets larger," firm says in note. Edwards holds about 60% of the TAVR market, which could slip to 57% next year as it competes with Medtronic and Abbott Labs . Edwards is expected to provide a market forecast at a meeting with analysts on Thursday. EW shares, down 0.3% Tuesday, are up 21% year-to-date. (peter.loftus@wsj.com; @Loftus)

1220 ET - Total wins a contract to fuel CMA CGM 's new container ships with natural gas over the next 10 years and looks to charter an LNG bunker vessel for the job as it expects more operators to switch to natural from heavy-bunker fuel. Deploying LNG refueling ships is one way to address concerns of limited availability in many ports across the world. For CMA CGM alone, which broke ground by choosing natural gas as the fuel choice for nine 22,000-box behemoths, Total will supply 300,000 tons of LNG a year. The value of the contract isn't known.

1219 ET - CEOs are expressing increasing optimism in capital spending while indicating less enthusiasm toward hiring, meaning companies could increasingly invest in capital instead of labor if tax reform comes to fruition. CEO plans for capital investment rose to the highest level since 2Q 2011, according to the Business Roundtable's 4Q survey. Meanwhile, hiring plans were less robust than in 3Q. The share of firms planning to reduce staff over the next six months rose slightly, while the share planning to increase hiring held steady. Jamie Dimon , chairman of the Business Roundtable and JPMorgan CEO, said business confidence is contingent on tax reform. "To continue this momentum, it is critical that we enact pro-growth tax reform that will level the playing field for US business to be globally competitive," he said. (sarah.chaney@wsj.com)

1214 ET - Microsoft will expand its Mountain View, Calif., campus by 643,000 square feet, about 35%, as part of a multibillion-dollar effort companywide to modernize and expand its office buildings. A week ago, the Redmond, Wash., software company announced plans to expand its headquarters, creating 2.5 million square feet of new office space, enough for at least 8,000 more employees. The company expects the workers to move into the new facilities on its 32-acre site in Mountain View in December 2019. Microsoft currently employs 2,000 workers in the Bay Area. The company doesn't plan to consolidate its other Bay Area facilities, in San Francisco, Palo Alto and Sunnyvale. Some of those properties were picked up through acquisitions of such companies as LinkedIn and Yammer. (jay.greene@wsj.com; @greene)

1206 ET - American Express CEO Kenneth Chenault says at an investor conference Tuesday that the number of people who signed up for the company's premium Platinum card since March increased more than 65% from a year ago. The company raised annual fees for the card in March to $550 from $450, leading to concerns among investors that new sign-ups and retention for the card would slip. Chenault says that existing Platinum cardholder retention levels "remain stable" since September, when the higher fee kicked in for those cardholders. (annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com)

1200 ET - Aphria soars 18% following news the Canadian medical cannabis grower struck a deal with Shoppers Drug Mart, Canada's biggest pharmacy chain, to supply it with medicinal marijuana.

1151 ET - Shares of DeVry University parent Adtalem Global Education surge 9% on news that it will sell DeVry and its Keller business school to Cogswell Education, a tiny college operator in California. Adtalem Global, which also runs the Ross medical school and Becker-branded training for professional certifications, says it will be able to focus more on those verticals now. Indicating just how much Adtalem Global wanted DeVry off its books, Adtalem gets nothing up-front on the deal--and in fact committed to transferring the school with a working capital balance of $7.5M-$20.1M, based on enrollment numbers. Adtalem Global could earn up to $20M over the next 10 years, depending on DeVry 's free cash flow. (melissa.korn@wsj.com; @melissakorn)

1149 ET - Kroger CFO Mike Schlotman says late deliveries from suppliers "clearly has been a problem for us," and the US's largest supermarket chain had more late trucks than he thought. "The window is wide. It baffles me why any sophisticated or semi-sophisticated supplier can't get a truck to us in two days," Schlotman says at a Barclays investor conference. Kroger was late to join retailers such as Wal-Mart in fining tardy suppliers, but money has flowed in since doing so in August, he says. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)

1145 ET - Kroger says the tax bill being reconciled in Congress would benefit it across the board, but a provision that could limit the deductibility of corporate debt would hurt competitors that are highly-levered. "Some people will run into an issue with that," CFO Mike Schlotman says at a Barclays investor conference. "I don't think everybody in our industry is going to wind up in the same situation." Schlotman says Kroger , the US's largest grocer, will take until the end of January to evaluate the implications of the tax plan before deciding how to use the additional cash if it passes.

1145 ET - Tightening oil inventories among OECD nations and continued strong demand sounds like a win-win for energy stocks, but Tudor Pickering says "traction remains elusive," as investors demand more returns and less growth. "Growth has become tantamount to the proverbial four-letter word in some circles," it says, noting industry executives and investors are in a "tenuous dance" on issues such as free cash flow yields and full-cycle returns, which not only include drilling and operating costs but also land and major infrastructure -- things oil companies sometimes fail to mention in presentations. The companies striking the correct growth/returns balance will be those with "quality assets in preferred basins, scale, balance sheets with dry powder [and] proven execution," firms that Tudor says include Chevron and Anadarko.
