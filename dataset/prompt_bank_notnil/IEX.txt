Fitch Ratings -Chicago-08 December 2017: Fitch Ratings has placed the 'A-' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) on Dover Corporation on Rating Watch Negative following the company's announcement that it plans to spin off its wellsite business, which serves the upstream oil and gas industry. Fitch has also placed Dover's revolver and senior unsecured notes on Rating Watch Negative, and has affirmed the company's Short-Term IDR and commercial paper at 'F2'. Dover had $3.5 billion of debt outstanding as of Sept. 30, 2017. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Rating Watch: The Rating Watch Negative reflects the expected increase in Dover's financial leverage due to the loss of EBITDA from the spin-off of the wellsite business without a commensurate reduction in debt levels, and also takes into account the improvement in Dover's operating profile as a result of the spin-off. On a pro forma basis, debt/EBITDA increases to over 3x from 2.7x as of Sept. 30, 2017, compared with Fitch's prior expectation that leverage would improve to the low-2x range. Fitch expects to downgrade Dover one notch to 'BBB+' at or around the completion of the spin-off, which is expected no later than the second quarter of 2018.

Wellsite Spin-off: Following a review of strategic alternatives for the wellsite business, Dover has announced that it plans to spin off the business into a standalone, publicly traded company. Fitch Ratings believes that a spin-off of the business, which represents the majority of its energy segment, would modestly enhance the company's business profile by reducing its exposure to the cyclical upstream energy markets. Dover's wellsite business is composed of businesses that supply products for drilling, production and automation, and is estimated by Dover to generate $1 billion in revenues and $250 million of EBITDA in 2017.

Proceeds to Shareholders: The spun-off business is expected to raise $700 to 800 million of new debt and dividend the proceeds to Dover, which would use the proceeds to finance a $1 billion share repurchase program during 2018. The balance of the share repurchases would be financed with internally generated cash flow. None of the proceeds are earmarked for debt reduction, although Fitch expects the company could repay all or part of a $350 million senior note issue that matures in March 2018.

Deleveraging Slows: Pro-forma for the spin-off, and taking into account the growth in Dover's business and the repayment of up to $350 million of debt in 2018, Fitch expects debt/EBITDA in the mid-2x range at the end of 2018, up modestly from the level expected at the end of 2017 and down from 3.3x at the end of 2016. This compares with Fitch's prior expectation that leverage would improve to level closer to 2x at the end of 2018. Dover's leverage remains elevated following the completion of six acquisitions during 2016 totaling $1.6 billion.

End Market Turnaround: Fitch expects Dover will generate EBITDA growth from each of its four segments in 2017, leading to EBITDA of around $1.4 billion compared with $1.1 billion in 2016. This will be driven by a meaningful recovery in Dover's energy segment as it benefits from a turnaround in oil and gas drilling activity. Dover's fluids segment is also expected to generate strong sales and EBITDA growth supported by recent acquisitions. On a consolidated basis, Fitch expects Dover's sales growth in the mid-teens in 2017, supported by mid-single digit organic growth and acquisitions. Organic sales growth, excluding the spin-off, will likely moderate to a low single digit pace in 2018.

Margin Recovery: The EBITDA margin is expected to improve in 2017 as sales volumes improve, and to benefit in particular from the turnaround in the energy segment. Fitch expects additional margin recovery over the medium term supported by synergies from the acquired companies, continued organic sales growth and the company's ongoing efficiency initiatives.

Steady FCF: The rating is supported by healthy FCF after dividends of around $500 million in 2018, pro forma for the spin-off, due to relatively low capital intensity (capex/revenues of around 2.4%). The FCF margin has ranged from 6% to 7% historically, and is projected to remain within that range going forward. Fitch assumes FCF will be used for a combination of share repurchases and debt repayment in 2018 and that FCF will be used for a combination of acquisitions and share repurchases longer term.

DERIVATION SUMMARY

Dover is a diversified manufacturer that participates in a variety of end-markets, each of which has a different set of competitors. Parker-Hannifin Corp . ('A-'/Outlook Stable) is another diversified manufacturer at the same rating level. Parker-Hannifin is larger and more diversified than Dover, has a similar EBITDA margin (15% versus 16% for Dover) and, following a large acquisition, has similar financial leverage of around 3x moving toward 2x over three years.

Other peers include Snap-on Incorporated ('A'/Outlook Stable), which competes with Dover in vehicle repair equipment, and IDEX Corporation ('BBB+'/Outlook Negative) and ITT, Inc . ('BBB+'/Outlook Stable), which compete with Dover in pumps. Dover has higher financial leverage than these companies, though it is also larger and more diversified. No country-ceiling, parent/subsidiary or operating environment aspects impact the rating

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch's Key Assumptions Within The Agency's Rating Case for the Issuer

--Sales growth is expected to approach 14% to 15% in 2017, driven primarily by recent acquisitions and recovery in the energy segment, followed by 2.5% organic growth in 2018. The Rating Case assumes the wellsite spin-off occurs on

Jan. 1, 2018.

--EBITDA margins recover in 2017 to close to 18%, supported by a turnaround in the energy segment, but then narrow to a level closer to 17% in 2018 as a result of the mix effect of the spin-off.

--FCF after dividends at or above $500 million in 2017 and 2018.

--Debt/EBITDA is expected to track in the mid-2x range over the medium-term.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action

--Fitch could resolve the Rating Watch Negative and affirm Dover's ratings if the spin-off doesn't occur and the company continues to deleverage its balance sheet, with debt/EBITDA and funds from operations (FFO) adjusted leverage improving over the near term to a level at or below 2.0x and 3.0x, respectively.

Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action

--Fitch expects to downgrade Dover's Long-Term IDR to 'BBB+' at or around the time of the planned spin-off.

--In the absence of a spin-off, factors that could lead to a negative rating action include acquisitions or aggressive shareholder returns that prevent debt/EBITDA and funds from operations (FFO) adjusted leverage from improving over the near term to a level at or below 2.0x and 3.0x, respectively;

--A reduction in the FCF margin to below 4% to 5% due to reduced profitability or increased capex or dividends.

LIQUIDITY

Liquidity & Debt Structure: Liquidity was solid as of Sept. 30, 2017 and consisted of $322 million of cash and equivalents, of which $298 million was held outside of the U.S., and an unused $1 billion revolving credit facility expiring. Nov. 10, 2020. Dover uses this facility to backstop its CP program which had $132 million outstanding as of Sept. 30, 2017. In addition to the CP, the company had $3.4 billion of senior unsecured notes outstanding, with the nearest maturity being a $350 million note maturing in March 2018.
