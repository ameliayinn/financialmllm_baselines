OVERVIEW 
     -- American Express Credit Account Master Trust 's issuance is an ABS 
transaction backed by a pool of receivables generated by American Express  
credit card accounts and pay-over-time revolving credit features associated 
with charge card accounts that are owned by American Express Centurion Bank  or 
American Express Bank FSB . 
     -- We assigned our ratings to the class A and B certificates from series 
2017-6, 2017-7, and 2017-8. 
     -- The ratings reflect our view of the transaction's credit support, 
underlying payment structure and cash flow mechanics, and the legal structure, 
among other factors. 
 
DALLAS (S&P Global Ratings) Oct. 30, 2017--S&P Global Ratings today assigned 
its ratings to American Express Credit Account Master Trust 's $1.825 billion, 
$782.143 million, and $570.546 million series 2017-6, 2017-7, and 2017-8 
certificates, respectively (see list). 
 
The certificate issuance is an asset-backed securities transaction backed by a 
pool of receivables generated by American Express  credit card accounts and 
pay-over-time revolving credit features associated with charge card accounts 
that are owned by American Express Centurion Bank  or American Express Bank FSB . 
 
The ratings reflect: 
     -- Our view that the credit support for each class of certificates is 
sufficient to withstand the simultaneous stresses we apply for each rating 
category to our 4.75% base-case loss rate assumption, 25.0% base-case payment 
rate assumption, and 18.0% base-case yield assumption. In addition, we use 
stressed purchase rate, excess spread, and certificate interest rate 
assumptions to determine if sufficient credit support is available for the 
ratings. All of the stress assumptions outlined above are based on our current 
criteria and assumptions (see "U.S. Credit Card Securitizations: Methodology 
And Assumptions," published Aug. 24, 2017). 
     -- Our view that the 7% minimum transferor percentage is sufficient in 
our stress scenarios to absorb dilutions, or noncash reductions, in the 
receivables. 
     -- Our expectation that under a moderate ('BBB') stress scenario, all 
else being equal, our ratings will remain within one rating category of the 
assigned 'AAA (sf)' and 'AA+ (sf)' ratings in the next 12 months, based on our 
credit stability criteria (for more information, see "Methodology: Credit 
Stability Criteria," published May 3, 2010). 
     -- Our view of the credit risk inherent in the collateral loan pool based 
on our economic forecast, the trust portfolio's historical performance, the 
collateral characteristics, and vintage performance data. 
     -- The corporate credit ratings we assigned to American Express Travel 
Related Services Co. Inc . (TRS; A-/Stable/--), the servicer, and the 
originators, American Express Centurion Bank  (A-/Stable/A-2) and American 
Express Bank FSB  (A-/Stable/A-2). 
     -- TRS' servicing and collection experience and general operational 
practices. 
     -- Our opinion of the quality and consistency of FSB's and Centurion's 
account origination, underwriting, and account management practices. 
     -- Our expectation of the timely interest and the ultimate principal 
payments by the legal final maturity date, based on stressed cash flow 
modeling scenarios using assumptions commensurate with the assigned 'AAA (sf)' 
and 'AA+ (sf)' ratings. 
     -- The series 2017-6, 2017-7, and 2017-8 certificates' underlying payment 
structure and cash flow mechanics and the transaction's legal structure.
