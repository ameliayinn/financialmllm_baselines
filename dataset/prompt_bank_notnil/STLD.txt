1111 ET - Nucor offers 4Q EPS guidance of 25 cents to 30 cents, well below analysts' forecast of 68 cents. The steelmaker last year earned $2.07 a share in 4Q and 90 cents in 3Q. The company attributes the steep decline in 4Q to lower prices for new steel and markedly higher prices for scrap steel that Nucor uses to make its steel. Nucor says demand for steel has improved lately, prompting a round of price increases from the company and others that should help boost margins going forward. Nucor typically kicks off the guidance announcements by major steelmakers. Steel Dynamics and United States Steel are expected to follow. Nucor shares up slightly at $58.20 in today's broad-market rally. (robert.tita@wsj.com; @bob_tita)

1104 ET - Confidence is low in the safety of Boeing 's 737 MAX aircraft, according to a Bank of America survey of 2,135 people. About 80% of survey respondents said they would wait to fly the MAX, a sentiment that could cause demand uncertainty when the MAX returns to service, the bank says. Nearly three-quarters of respondents said they would switch flights if they're scheduled on a MAX jet. However, the bank says the majority of the public are infrequent fliers, and about half of respondents said they're somewhat unaware of the MAX grounding. (dave.sebastian@wsj.com; @depsebastian)

1046 ET - USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue says a sticking point in the US-China trade talks has been getting China to commit in writing to $40B to $50B in annual agricultural imports from the US. It's a colossal number that could double the biggest-ever annual US ag export total to China, and beyond that. Perdue says the US wants "enforceability" in the bargain. "We're looking for trust and assurance," he tells reporters at a Farmers Business Network conference in Omaha. (jacob.bunge@wsj.com; @jacobbunge)

1042 ET - Consumers spent 8.1% less in November compared with last year despite a promotion-laden early-holiday period, according to Bank of America , which didn't include Cyber Monday's early December sales in its analysis. Retail sales, excluding autos, grew 1.8% in November, the bank says. The bank's analysis of its credit and debit card data shows deceleration in retail categories after picking up in October, citing less store traffic around Black Friday as consumers looked for better online deals on Cyber Monday. Discount apparel sales grew 4.6% in November, the investment bank says. (dave.sebastian@wsj.com; @depsebastian)

0956 ET - Asia has trumped Continental Europe as an attractive location for cross-border investing among US private-equity and venture-capital firms, according to a survey of 200 firms conducted by midmarket financial advisory firm BDO USA. Among private-equity firms surveyed, 30% cited Asia and Southeast Asia as the most attractive region for cross-border investment, up from 27% of firms in a similar survey a year ago. By contrast, only 16% of firms surveyed cited Continental Europe as most attractive, down from 45% of firms in last year's survey. "Besides China, you have upticks in places like Korea, Vietnam and other [Asian countries]," said Scott Hendon, co-leader of global private equity at BDO USA. "We see a bit of dampening on some of the China stuff with the tariffs, but the overall market in Asia has bigger upside than the European or Latin American markets."

0914 ET - UBS assumed coverage of GE with a buy rating, encouraging clients to buy the stock ahead of 2020 when the firm predicts better understanding of a turnaround and the company's cash drags turning into cash flows. The stock, with a $14 price target, should continue to perform "as the narrative on the stock shifts from survival to transformation." UBS sees 2020 free cash flow of $2.3B excluding the biopharma business it is selling, compared to an estimate of $700M this year including $1.3B coming from biopharma. UBS sees 2022 cash flow of $5B-$6B. Shares rise 3.6% premarket to $11.36. (thomas.gryta@wsj.com; @tgryta)

0836 ET - The prices businesses charge their customers, known as producer prices for final demand, rose 1.1% from a year earlier in November, a sharp slowdown from a 2.6% annual increase recorded in November 2018. When removing volatile food, energy and trade services costs, a similar cooling trend is in place, to a 1.3% gain last month from a 2.9% increase a year earlier. Economists and policymakers tend to be more concerned with prices paid by consumers, but the producer figures show that rising wages and trade disputes aren't giving businesses much leeway to raise prices.

0833 ET - Jobless claims rose to 252,000 in the week ended December 7, the highest level for claims since September 2017 when they clocked in at 257,000, according to the Labor Department. The sharp rise in weekly claims likely reflects volatility with seasonal adjustment around the Thanksgiving holiday, which arrived later than usual this year. There were 203,000 claims recorded in the final week of November and an average of 224,000 claims over the last four weeks, historically low numbers that offer evidence the labor market is healthy.
