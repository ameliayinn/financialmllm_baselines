1106 ET - Cisco is reviewing the House Democrats' tax proposals and the potential impact on its business, CFO Scott Herren says. "No one wants to see the tax rate go up from 21% to 26.5%," Herren says, adding that it is important that there are no changes that make it less appealing for businesses to invest in the US. Cisco says it welcomes that the House Democrats' proposal keeps the existing framework around foreign derived intangible income in place, which was the reason for the company to relocate a large proportion of its intellectual property back to the US following the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

1058 ET - Danish boxship giant AP Moller-Maersk adds $4B to its 2021 profit guidance on the back of record volumes and surging container freight rates. Maersk , the world's biggest container ship operator, said it expects a full year Ebitda of $22B to $23B from $18B to 19B previously. "The strong result is driven by the continuation of the exceptional market situation, which has led to further increases in both long and short-term container freight rates," Maersk said, adding that it upped its guidance because its performance in the first two months of the third quarter was "significantly ahead" of previous expectations.(costas.paris@wsj.com)

1056 ET - While EIA data yesterday showed US gasoline consumption--a key yardstick for overall oil demand--fell sharply to 8.9M barrels a day, that softening may be more than offset by growing demand in Asia led by the world's No. 2 and No. 3 oil consumers after the US--China and India. "There are further signs that Chinese appetite for oil looks set to strengthen after months of meager crude oil imports from the world's largest oil importer," says StoneX's Kevin Solomon, adding that in India, "preliminary data revealed that Indian gasoline sales in H1 September are above 2019 levels as the nation's recovery from the Delta variant gathers steam."

0947 ET - Buyout shops and other buyers are acquiring midmarket companies with increased amounts of debt in relation to the profits the businesses generate, as lenders flush of cash are willing to finance those deals, according to Capstone Partners. US midmarket deals recorded a total debt-to-Ebitda multiple of 5.7x during 2Q, the highest level since 2005, the investment bank says. "A robust M&A environment and a continued supply/demand imbalance for middle-market transactions caused lenders to increase leverage to win deals." Capstone adds, however, that equity capital must still account for about half of the purchase value in most cases. (luis.garcia@wsj.com; @lhvgarcia)

0916 ET - Supply chain, freight costs, the spread of the Delta variant and inflation are all headaches for retailers. But at least their balance sheets have improved over the last 18 to 24 months, with elevated cash balances, falling leverage levels and accelerating free cash flow generation, Wells Fargo says. Companies that have taken the biggest strides on that front include Academy Sports and Outdoors, Bath & Body Works , Signet Jewelers , Dick's Sporting Goods and Tapestry , the bank says. Those that have seen a stepback include VF Corp ., driven by debt taken in part to fund its Supreme deal, Wells Fargo adds. (dave.sebastian@wsj.com; @depsebastian)

0839 ET - Agricultural giant Cargill says it is signing up farmers for a new program that will compensate them for adopting more environmentally friendly practices. Farmers that keep their fields covered with vegetation throughout the year or reduce tilling soil -- ways to withdraw more carbon from the atmosphere, and trap it in the ground -- can earn $20 per ton of carbon sequestered, a spokeswoman says. The effort is part of Cargill's own sustainability commitments, and research shows that better soil management can improve profits for corn and soybean farmers, the company says.
