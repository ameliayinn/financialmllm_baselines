Home Depot -- HD-NYSE Buy -- Price $181.80 on Dec. 12 by Guggenheim

We view the home-improvement subsector as one of the most attractive in retail, given its myriad of distinct top- and bottom-line growth drivers, its healthy free-cash-flow dynamics, and the business models that keep it relatively insulated from pure-play e-commerce threats. It also has share-holding advantages, highly complex supply-chain infrastructures, and maturing and improving homegrown e-commerce offerings.

There are two key players, Home Depot and Lowe's. We apply a Buy rating to both, but think there are some small but clear differences that favor Home Depot, including the likelihood of an ongoing valuation gap between them due to HD's greater exposure to urban counties and the lucrative professional customer segment, higher levels of productivity and profitability resulting in stronger free-cash-flow dynamics, lower leverage ratios with a higher secular growth outlook, and superior infrastructure-related assets.

For Home Depot, we are initiating coverage with the previously mentioned Buy rating and a $200 price target.

PayPal Holdings -- PYPL-Nasdaq Buy -- Price $73.62 on Dec. 12 by Nomura Instinet

The company mints money, with its liquidity standing at approximately $20 billion.

The ability to invest for growth and simultaneously return capital to shareholders are hallmarks of a truly great business, and we think PayPal is capable of doing both. We believe it has the capacity to fund organic and nonorganic growth as well as buybacks, particularly with some $7 billion of liquidity on hand at the end of third-quarter 2017 and another $13 billion, more or less, at its disposal.

We, of course, expect PayPal to preserve healthy amounts of liquidity, but we now see greater buyback capacity and are modeling an incremental $2.5 billion of share repurchases from third-quarter 2018 through fourth-quarter 2019. We view the company as a compounder and believe that shares acquired now will generate significant value. We therefore raise our year-end 2018 target price to $82 from $79.

Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings -- KNX-NYSE Overweight -- Price $42.99 on Dec. 12 by Morgan Stanley

As the largest U.S. trucker, Knight-Swift is the carrier most likely to benefit from mandated electronic-logging-device upside in 2018-19. (ELD systems give companies a way to monitor and manage, in real time or in archived records, their drivers, shipments, and vehicles.) Add in the company's layers of merger synergies and potential secular opportunities, and Knight-Swift is our top pick in the freight-transportation sector.

Knight-Swift has the largest one-way truckload, or TL, exposure among big trucking carriers and has historically been the most nimble in the spot market ("add-ons" that can account for up to 20% of one-way TL revenue). As such, we believe it is potentially the carrier most exposed to the benefits of ELD-driven pricing gains in 2018. Industry surveys point to at least mid-single digit rate increases in next year's bid season coupled with volume, utilization, and operating ratio gains, only partly offset by wage increases.

We believe that Knight-Swift's scale and exposure can make it the biggest beneficiary of ELD-mandated benefits, where our expectations are above consensus. We also see their cost synergy targets from the Knight-Swift merger as conservative and believe that the merged company can be a fast follower with new intelligent trucking technologies. Knight-Swift's diversification with the asset-light business should help in the event of a macro slowdown.

We expect revenue to grow at high-single-digit percentages (mid-single-digit price increases and low-single-digit utilization improvement) in 2018 and 2019. We see cost synergies of $75 million in 2018 and $100 million in 2019. We assume a tax rate of 38%. Our price target: $50.

Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. -- AJG-NYSE Overweight -- Price $64.79 on Dec. 12 by Barclays

Our takeaways from the recent AJG investors meeting:

1) AJG anticipates modest commercial property-and-casualty rate increases following $100 billion-plus of catastrophe losses in the third quarter of 2017.

2) Its insurance brokerage organic revenue growth is expected to accelerate slightly in fiscal 2018, driven by firmer P&C pricing and exposure growth following fiscal-year 2017 organic growth expectations of slightly above 3.6%.

(3) AJG remains focused on bolt-on acquisitions rather than large deals. The pipeline is still robust despite competition from private equity buyers.

(4) A U.S. corporate tax rate of 20% could boost AJG's annual earnings by 14% if the corporate alternative minimum tax is eliminated, but earning power could decline 7% if the 20% corporate AMT remains in the final bill.

Our price target: $70.
