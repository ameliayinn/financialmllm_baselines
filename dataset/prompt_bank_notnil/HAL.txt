1218 ET - Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood says her company's Azure cloud-computing unit sees increasing competition for business with Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform business. Hood, who made the comments at the Wells Fargo Tech Summit in Park City, Utah, last week, says "we've been talking about seeing them in this market for years, but I would say we've seen more of them in the past few quarters than we've seen before," according to a transcript of the event. Google Cloud held a 2.3% share of the global cloud infrastructure market, compared to Microsoft Azure's 7.1% in 2016, according to Gartner . Amazon's cloud-computing unit dominated the market with a 44.2% share. Hood also showered Google Cloud boss Diane Greene with praise as well, calling her "a winner" and "an excellent leader and an established enterprise CEO." (jay.greene@wsj.com; @greene)

1207 ET - Airbnb could end up in a costly showdown with the city of Paris, one of its most profitable markets. Paris is giving Airbnb until early January to remove a sample 1,000 listings that it says don't comply with a new law that obliges Parisians renting out their primary residences on a short-term basis to display a city registration number in their listings. The city says the registration numbers help track compliance with a 120-night cap per year. But Airbnb has said won't force its hosts to display the numbers because the site doesn't know which listings are legally required to show them. Last month, in an effort to diffuse tensions, Airbnb said it would start blocking hosts in central Paris from listing apartments beyond the 120-night-per-year cap. But the move was met with scorn by city officials who said it should apply to all of Paris. If unresolved, the fight could end up in court.

1121 ET - Richard Berner, the departing director of the Office of Financial Research, will join New York University's Stern School of Business effective January 1, the school says. Berner announced in November he was leaving his post before the end of a six-year term. He is set to be replaced on an acting basis by Treasury Department Chief Risk Officer Ken Phelan. Berner will be the first to hold the title of executive-in-residence of the school's Center for Global Economy and Business, and will serve as an adjunct professor in the economics department, NYU says.

1113 ET - A global grain glut continues to squeeze the world's largest crop traders, and Archer Daniels Midland takes another step to streamline operations, announcing the sale of its soybean-processing facilities in Bolivia. Lima-based Inversiones Piuranas SA will acquire ADM's Bolivian processing plant and nine grain silos in the deal, which ADM expects to close in the first half of 2018, while not disclosing any sale price. ADM's net income dropped 44% in its most recent quarter, as US grain exports slowed and persistently low crop prices have cut into trading and processing profits for the companies that dominate agricultural commodity trading. ADM shares rise 0.5%, and are down 8.6% so far this year. (jacob.bunge@wsj.com; @jacobbunge)

1109 ET - An esports league under development by The NBA and videogame publisher Take-Two has an official logo, the organizations announced Monday, though a start date has yet to be revealed. The NBA and Take-Two haven't made any major announcements about the league since May when it revealed that 17 NBA teams--including the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors --would field esports squads for matches of Take-Two's "NBA 2K" videogame starting in 2018. The joint venture was first unveiled in February, a few months after Activision disclosed it was building a city-based esports league around its "Overwatch" game. That league kicked off pre-season matches last week, and the official season is slated to begin on Jan. 10. (sarah.needleman@wsj.com; @saraheneedleman)

1033 ET - Bluebird shares are up 19% after reporting positive results of a small clinical trial of its experimental treatment, bb2121, for the blood cancer multiple myeloma, at a medical conference over the weekend. The treatment, known as a "CAR-T," reduced cancer cells in most patients. Bernstein called the data "very strong" and noted the company and its partner, Celgene , which licensed the drug, plan to bring it to market by 2020. Credit Suisse predicts the treatment will generate $2.1B in peak annual sales if it reaches market. (peter.loftus@wsj.com; @Loftus)

1025 ET - Phillips 66 and Enbridge announce "open season" beginning today for the Gray Oak Pipeline. This will allow them to gauge interest on the pipeline system that would begin service in 2H 2019 and move crude oil from west Texas to refining and export destination markets along the Gulf of Mexico such as Corpus Christi, Freeport and Houston. The joint statement says the line would have an initial 385k bpd capacity, but that number could rise depending on shipping interest. There's been a rush recently among midstream companies to start providing transport options for oil companies in the Permian basin of west Texas and New Mexico, where production now stands at about 2.7M bpd, a hefty portion of total US output of 9.5M bpd.

1013 ET - There were just under 6 million job openings at the end of October, the Labor Department says. The number of openings ticked down from 6.18 million at the end of September, but remained near the highest level on record back to 2000. The rate at which employers hired, or filled those openings, improved in October and the rate at which workers were dismissed from their jobs slowed slightly. The data is consistent with other measures of the labor market showing some firms are finding it more challenging to find workers to fill jobs. (eric.morath@wsj.com; @ericmorath)

1003 ET - Few new refineries will start producing fuel in 2018, but roughly 800,000 barrels a day of new distillation capacity will come online next year as existing plants debottleneck their systems, according to OPEC . Kuwait's national oil company is an investor in a new 200,000 b/d plant in Vietnam, which will run Kuwaiti crude. In Canada, a 50,000 b/d refinery in Redwater, Alberta will enter its first full year of operation - the first such plant built in Canada in 30 years. But the small refinery will process Canadian crude and sell refined products locally, so it's not expected to impact trade flows, according to Poten & Partners , which tracks fuel movements. Another new refinery with somewhat limited trade impact on oil is the 200,000 b/d Star refinery that Azerbaijan's state oil is building in Turkey. It will run primarily Azeri crude, but also buy from Russia and Iraq. (lynn.cook@wsj.com; @LynnJCook)

0956 ET - Hedge fund Elliott Management continues to push for a higher price in Qualcomm 's planned purchase of NXP Semiconductors or another deal as it released a public website Monday laying out its valuation estimate for the business. Elliott confirms a November WSJ report that it had enlisted investment bank UBS Group to help in its efforts. The deal, announced in October 2016, valued NXP at $39B, or $110 a share. Since then there has been a slew of deals in the space. Elliott said it believes NXP should be valued at $135 a share. Shares of NXP rose 1.1% to $116.50. (austen.hufford@wsj.com; @austenhufford)

0948 ET - A refinery operator in Poland is testing out US and Canadian crude oil in its Gdansk plant ahead of a big expansion. Grupa LOTUS is upgrading its refinery on the Baltic Sea and adding between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels a day of capacity in 2018, which will impact trade flows, according to Poten & Partners , which tracks tanker shipments. Russian Urals crude will remain a key feedstock for the Polish refinery, and LOTUS also sources oil from the North Sea and the Middle East. But it recently bought two cargoes of light, sweet crude from the US and before that a cargo of Hibernia crude pumped off the east coast of Canada to test in the plant, Poten says. Poland is heavily dependent on Russia for oil and gas, but earlier this year it imported its first cargo of US-sourced liquefied natural gas (LNG). (lynn.cook@wsj.com; @LynnJCook)
