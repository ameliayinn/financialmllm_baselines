STERIS 's securities filings or otherwise with respect to any regulatory 
action, administrative proceedings, government investigations, 
litigation, warning letters, cost reductions, business strategies, 
earnings or revenue trends or future financial results. References to 
products are summaries only and should not be considered the specific 
terms of the product clearance or literature. Unless legally required, 
STERIS  does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking 
statements even if events make clear that any projected results, express 
or implied, will not be realized. Other potential risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from 
those in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation, (a) 
STERIS 's ability to meet expectations regarding the accounting and tax 
treatments of the Combination (the "Combination") with STERIS 
Corporation  and Synergy Health plc  ("Synergy"), (b) the possibility that 
the parties may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating 
efficiencies in connection with the Combination within the expected 
time-frames or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of 
the companies, (c) the integration of the operations of the companies 
being more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected, (d) 
operating costs, customer loss and business disruption (including, 
without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with

following the transaction, (e) the retention of certain key employees of

could increase our consolidated tax liabilities, including, changes in 
tax laws that would result in STERIS  being treated as a domestic 
corporation for United States federal tax purposes, (g) the potential 
for increased pressure on pricing or costs that leads to erosion of 
profit margins, (h) the possibility that market demand will not develop 
for new technologies, products or applications or services, or business 
initiatives will take longer, cost more or produce lower benefits than 
anticipated, (i) the possibility that application of or compliance with 
laws, court rulings, certifications, regulations, regulatory actions, 
including without limitation those relating to FDA  warning notices or 
letters, government investigations, the outcome of any pending FDA  
requests, inspections or submissions, or other requirements or standards 
may delay, limit or prevent new product introductions, affect the 
production and marketing of existing products or services or otherwise 
affect STERIS 's performance, results, prospects or value, (j) the 
potential of international unrest, economic downturn or effects of 
currencies, tax assessments, adjustments or anticipated rates, raw 
material costs or availability, benefit or retirement plan costs, or 
other regulatory compliance costs, (k) the possibility of reduced demand, 
or reductions in the rate of growth in demand, for STERIS 's products and 
services, (l) the possibility that anticipated growth, cost savings, new 
product acceptance, performance or approvals, or other results may not 
be achieved, or that transition, labor, competition, timing, execution, 
regulatory, governmental, or other issues or risks associated with 
STERIS 's businesses, industry or initiatives including, without 
limitation, those matters described in STERIS 's 10-K for the year ended 
March 31, 2017 and other securities filings, may adversely impact 
STERIS 's performance, results, prospects or value, (m) the impact on 
STERIS  and its operations of the "Brexit" or the exit of other member 
countries from the EU , (n) the impact on STERIS  and its operations of 
any legislation, regulations or orders, including but not limited to any 
new trade or tax legislation, regulations or orders, that may be 
implemented by the new U.S. administration or Congress, or of any 
responses thereto, (o) the possibility that anticipated financial 
results or benefits of recent acquisitions, including the Combination, 
or of STERIS 's restructuring efforts, or of recent divestitures will not 
be realized or will be other than anticipated and (p) the effects of the 
contractions in credit availability, as well as the ability of STERIS 's
