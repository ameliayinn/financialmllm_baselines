1736 ET - Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) CEO Meg Whitman says the company's strong quarter is reflective of the company's longer-term strategy. "If you pull the lens all the way back, we've tried to stabilize the core and then pivot the portfolio to those higher-growth higher-margin products and that's working," she tells WSJ. From a revenue perspective, HPE has stabilized losses in the core industry-standard server business, which has faced pressure from declines in the overall market. The company is also seeing benefits from acquisitions including SGI, with its high-performance computing products, and SimpliVity, systems that combine compute and storage.(rachael.king@wsj.com; @sfwriter)

1719 ET - The semiconductor industry is healthy but destined to contract, signaling that investors will set their sights on value rather than growth, according to market research firm CFRA. Based on 25 large semi stocks, CFRA's analysis found that earnings expectations are outpacing stock performance, while the average year-on-year revenue growth rate has reached a six-year high with likely declines ahead as demand softens for smartphones and PCs. Shares such as Broadcom (AVGO) and Intel (INTC) will become more attractive, the report concludes, with "negative implications" for memory maker Micron Technology (MU) and graphics specialist Nvidia (NVDA).

1717 ET - Bill Gross's old mutual fund had its first monthly increase in new client money in more than four years. Pacific Investment Management Co.'s Total Return Fund, the flagship bond fund Gross ran until his 2014 ouster, had $348M in net inflows in August, excluding reinvested dividends, a person familiar with the matter says. The results snapped a streak that began in April 2013, and accelerated once Gross departed. Pimco Total Return had about $74B in assets under management; in 2013, before clients began to exit, the fund managed more than $290B. (justin.baer@wsj.com)

1710 ET - In spite of the wallop Hurricane Harvey packed, Fitch Ratings sees little to no effect for the credit ratings of the two big Houston Airports, George Bush Intercontinental and William P. Hobby. "While the facilities themselves may have sustained limited to moderate damage and flooding from the storm event," Fitch says, the bigger problem may have been access to the airports. But that problem is past and the parking garages at both facilities are safe and escaped flood waters, Fitch says. The Houston Airport System, which runs them both, says Bush is now operating at 75% of normal operations. Southwest Airlines (LUV) the main carrier at Hobby, has resumed 60% of normal operations, the ratings agency says. (susan.carey@wsj.com)

1710 ET - Tyson Foods' (TSN) plans to build a new chicken complex will require up to 1.25M chickens a week--much more than currently are raised in eastern Kansas, where TSN plans to build the plant. Kansas doesn't rank among the top 30 chicken-producing states and nearby Missouri is ninth, well behind the poultry powerhouses of the US south. TSN aims to sign up farmers who will invest in chicken barns to raise birds supplied by the company, and its feed mill will become a big buyer of crops from local farmers, adding a source of demand for farmers and competition for local grain companies and cattle ranches. TSN estimates the plant will generate a $150M annual economic benefit to Kansas. (jacob.bunge@wsj.com; @jacobbunge)

1642 ET - JP Morgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) both speak out against the Trump Administration's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects from deportation undocumented immigrants who enter the US as children. "We should do everything in our power to continue to attract the best and brightest because they make us stronger as a people and as an economy," says JPM CEO James Dimon, who is also chairman of the Business Roundtable, a group that lobbies for businesses. "And, when people come here to learn, work hard and give back to their communities, we should allow them to stay in the US." A WFC spokeswoman says in a statement: "Wells Fargo believes young, undocumented immigrants brought to America as children should have the opportunity to stay in the US. DACA is relevant to our team members and the communities we serve." (emily.glazer@wsj.com; @EmilyGlazerWSJ)

1642 ET - Canadian bonds are mixed ahead of the Bank of Canada's next rate decision, with the front-end vastly underperforming the rest of the curve. The yield for Canada's two-year bonds is 1.346% from 1.337% late Friday, according to electronic trading platform CanDeal. The 10-year bond yield is 1.860% from 1.913%. Canada's bond market was closed Monday in observances of the Labor Day holiday. The bond curve is widely expected to narrow Wednesday with the BOC either expected to hike rates or issue a rather hawkish statement. TD Securities notes the spread between 2s and 10s could move to about 40 basis points from the current 52 basis point gap on a rate hike, while a hawkish statement could keep the spread flat.
