Fitch Ratings-New York-02 October 2017: Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating/Rating Watch Positive to Oncor Electric Delivery Company, LLC 's (Oncor) $325 million 3.80% senior secured notes due 2047. Fitch placed Oncor on Rating Watch Positive following the announcement by Sempra Energy (IDR 'BBB+'/Outlook Stable) to acquire, along with a consortium of investors, 100% of the equity of reorganized Energy Future Holdings Corp . (EFH). EFH indirectly owns an 80% equity interest in Oncor.

Oncor plans to use the net proceeds from the issuance to redeem a portion of the $324.4 million 5.00% senior secured notes due 2017, repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility, which totalled $1.156 billion as of June 30, 2017, and for general corporate purposes.

Fitch will likely resolve the Rating Watch and the constrained notching of the senior secured debt at or close to the completion of the transaction. The transaction is subject to receiving approval from the bankruptcy court of EFH's amended reorganization plan, the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), and the Private Letter Ruling from the IRS confirming the tax-free nature of the transaction. Approvals are also needed from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and under Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act.Â

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Regulatory Approval is Key: Sempra intends to apply for PUCT's approval for the change of control shortly. Its merger agreement has been approved by the bankruptcy court. Fitch currently does not anticipate any significant customer concessions as part of the merger approval process; the ring fencing provisions, $3 billion of debt at reorganized EFH and the governance structure at both Oncor and its direct parent, Oncor Electric Delivery Holdings Company LLC (Oncor Holdings), would likely occupy greater attention in the merger proceedings. The acquisition by Sempra , if completed, will finally resolve the drawn-out bankruptcy proceedings for Oncor's indirect parent holding company. Fitch has been constraining the Oncor's IDR one-notch below its peer utilities in Texas and has further constrained the senior secured debt an additional notch.

Sempra has agreed to the same set of regulatory commitments as proposed by Berkshire Hathaway Energy during their planned acquisition of Oncor with a key difference being that Sempra 's transaction contemplates $3 billion of debt at reorganized EFH. However, Sempra has committed to pay off that debt in seven years or less and not to incur any additional debt at that level. The other proposed regulatory commitments ensure that Oncor remains tightly ring-fenced to address the PUCT's clear preference for a strong independent board at Oncor, a factor that had become a sticking point in the last change of control proceeding involving Nextera Energy, Inc . These commitments include majority independent boards at both Oncor and Oncor Holdings with significant rights with respect to dividend and capital investment decisions. Sempra has also committed that Oncor's credit rating at the time of transaction closing will be the same or better than that at June 30th and, in addition, has offered to suspend dividends if Oncor's senior secured debt is rated below 'BBB' by any of the three rating agencies. Sempra will also work with the other owners to infuse equity in Oncor within 180 days of closing of the transaction so as to achieve a 42.5% equity ratio, which is in line with the settlement reached recently in Oncor's rate case proceeding. Finally, as per the merger agreement, Texas Transmission Inc. can continue as a minority holder in Oncor with approximately 20% ownership interest.

Strong Performance to Continue; Oncor continues to deliver strong operational and financial performance; the latter is driven by a combination of sales growth and significant transmission investments backed with constructive recovery mechanisms. Weather-adjusted residential sales and large commercial and industrial (C&I) sales continue to be robust despite the muted oil and gas related activity in Texas as compared to prior years. Residential points of delivery have seen a robust annual growth of 1.9% for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2017. Demand from large commercial and industrial (C&I) customers increased 1.3% in the most recent quarter compared to the year ago period.

Rate Case Settlement Marginally Positive: On March 17, 2017, Oncor filed a rate case request with the PUCT to increase its transmission and distribution rates by approximately $317 million (a 7.5% increase) based upon a capital structure of 55% debt and 45% equity (versus 60/40 currently) and return on equity of 10.25% (same as currently authorized). The rate increase request was primarily driven by recovery of approximately $7.9 billion of investments made since June 30, 2010, the end of its most recent rate case test year, and increase in O&M costs over this period. In addition, Oncor is also seeking recovery of over $1 billion in regulatory assets. Oncor reached a settlement with the PUCT staff and key intervenors that allows for a 3.4% rate increase for Oncor effective Nov. 27, 2017 based on a 42.5% equity ratio and 9.8% ROE. However, the timing for implementation of the new regulatory capital structure has not been determined yet. Oncor also agreed to exchange certain assetsÂ withÂ Sharyland Distribution & Transmission Services L.L.C. (SDTS), whereby SDTS will provide certain distribution assets and limited transmission assets to Oncor (approximately $401 million book value), and Oncor will provide certain transmission assets (approximately $380 million book value) plus the difference in book value as cash to SDTS. The transaction and rate case settlement is subject to the PUCT approval. The transaction is also subject to the receipt of consent from SDTS lenders, and clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act. The transaction has already received approval from the bankruptcy court.

Stable Credit Metrics: For the last 12-months ending June 30, 2017, Oncor reported FFO interest charge coverage ratio of 5.3x, and adjusted debt to EBITDAR of 3.8x. These metrics are strong compared to a median financial profile of a 'BBB' regulated transmission and distribution utility.Fitch estimates Oncor's FFO Interest coverage to remain approximately 5.0x and adjusted debt to EBITDAR to remain approximately 4.0x over 2017-2021. Oncor is planning to spend approximately $1.5 billion in capex in 2017 and more than $1.6 billion annually over 2018-2021. Transmission capex is approximately 50% of the total projected capex and various tracker mechanisms allow Oncor to earn a return on transmission related capital investment with minimal regulatory lag.

DERIVATION SUMMARY

Fitch has been constraining Oncor's IDR by one-notch compared to its peer transmission and distribution utilities in Texas, which include CenterPoint Houston Electric Inc. (CEHE; IDR: BBB+/Outlook Stable) and AEP Texas Inc. (BBB+/Outlook Stable). The notching of the senior secured debt at Oncor has been further constrained to reflect Oncor's ownership by a bankrupt parent that limits Oncor's access to equity to retention of dividend. The adjusted debt to EBITDAR for Oncor (approximately 4.0x) is weaker compared to CEHE (3.5x) given a lower proportion of equity in the approved regulatory capital structure (40% versus CEHE's 45%) and relatively higher capex. Oncor's adjusted debt to EBITDAR is better than AEP Texas (4.5x) due to proportionately higher capex at the latter and similar regulatory capital structure. Oncor's last authorized return on equity was 10.25% compared to 10.0% at CEHE and 9.96% at AEP Texas. If the recent settlement stipulation is approved by the PUCT, Oncor's equity ratio will increase to 42.5% but authorized ROE will decline to 9.8%.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for Oncor include:

--No material customer concessions required as part of PUCT's approval for the Sempra acquisition;

--Volumetric sales growth of 1% p.a. in 2017 and 1.5% thereafter;

--O&M costs inflated at 3% annually;

--Recent settlement stipulation approved by the PUCT;

--Regulatory capital structure of 57.5% debt and 42.5% equity and rate increase in 2020;

--Capex of $1.5 billion in 2017 and then $1.6 billion annually till 2021;

--Pension funding of $740 million from 2017 - 2021.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action

--Conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings of EFH;

--Continued commitment by Sempra to pay off the debt at reorganized EFH within seven years; and

--Strengthening of the current ring-fencing provisions.

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action

--Weak ring-fencing provisions that lead to a close rating linkage between Oncor and a weak parent;

--Material amount of debt above Oncor Holdings with limited visibility on deleveraging;

--Adverse outcomes in future rate cases such as significant sharing of tax benefits with ratepayers or material reduction in authorized ROEs;

--Sustained weakness in total adjusted debt to EBITDAR measures above 4.5x.

LIQUIDITY

Oncor's $2 billion corporate revolving facility is due October 2018. Fitch expects Oncor to extend the maturity of revolver and secure commitments from its bank group on a timely basis. Under the terms of the corporate revolver, the lenders' commitments are several and not joint.

Press Release: Fitch Rates Oncor's Senior Secured -2-

As of June 30, 2017, Oncor had $1.16 billion of borrowings under the revolving credit facility and $9 million of outstanding LCs. The drawn balances are large and reflect a high capex spend; Oncor typically draws on its corporate revolver to fund capital work in progress and subsequently replaces the drawn balances with permanent financing and/or internally generated funds. Since EFH filed for bankruptcy protection, Oncor has accessed debt markets on several occasions to term out its revolver. Fitch believes Oncor continues to have access to debt markets to refinance or issue new debt.
