NEW YORK, Dec. 7, 2017

NEW YORK, Dec. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE: EW), the global leader in patient-focused innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring, will discuss the company's strategy for longer-term growth, provide an update on its technology pipeline and share its financial guidance during its annual investor conference today in New York City.

Highlights of today's conference include: 


   -- Reaffirming October 2017 financial guidance1 
 
   -- Projected 2018 global sales of $3.5 to $3.9 billion, representing 
      underlying2 growth of 9 to 10% 
 
   -- Projected 2018 THVT sales of $2.1 to $2.4 billion, representing 
      underlying growth of 11 to 15% 
 
   -- Estimated 2018 adjusted earnings per share3 of $4.10 to $4.30 
 
   -- Aggressive R&D investments pursuing large opportunities in transcatheter 
      valve therapies expected to drive continued organic growth 

"As we come to the end of 2017, our performance and accomplishments this year significantly exceeded our expectations, and we expect 2018 to be another strong year for Edwards Lifesciences . Our global growth is being driven by our transcatheter aortic valve therapies, and continued advancement in each of our market-leading product lines," said Michael A. Mussallem , chairman and CEO. "In 2018, we are projecting strong financial results while we continue to invest aggressively to provide breakthrough therapies for patients in need. During the year, we expect to achieve a number of meaningful clinical milestones that will serve as indicators of our progress in advancing multiple transcatheter mitral and tricuspid programs."

Among the topics being discussed at today's conference are: 


   -- Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy -- Edwards continues to believe the 
      global TAVR opportunity will exceed $5 billion by 2021 and continue to 
      grow thereafter, fueled by broader indications for its TAVR therapy, 
      greater therapy awareness and advances in the technology. Edwards is also 
      investing in research and development to produce transformational TAVR 
      technologies to further strengthen its leadership position. The company 
      continues to anticipate launches of its Edwards SAPIEN 3 Ultra system and 
      Edwards CENTERA valve system in 2018. In its clinical trial studying 
      low-risk surgical patients, Edwards expects results to be presented in 
      the first half of 2019 followed by commercial approval in late 2019. 
 
   -- Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies -- Estimated to be a more 
      than $3 billion opportunity by 2025, Edwards will discuss its multiple 
      transcatheter programs aimed at transforming care for the many patients 
      suffering from mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. The company has made 
      significant progress in many of its programs and is expecting to achieve 
      a number of meaningful clinical milestones in 2018. Edwards plans to 
      launch at least one transformational therapy in Europe each year in 2018, 
      2019 and 2020 led by its Cardioband and PASCAL programs. 
 
   -- Surgical Heart Valve Therapy -- Edwards expects growth in its 
      market-leading surgical heart valve portfolio despite the continued 
      strong adoption of TAVR therapy in more developed regions. The company is 
      pursuing a robust pipeline of innovative new products including the 
      Edwards INTUITY Elite valve system, and the Edwards INSPIRIS valve, which 
      is expected to be introduced in the U.S. and Japan in 2018. As announced 
      yesterday, Edwards acquired Harpoon Medical and plans to launch this 
      mitral repair therapy in Europe next year. 
 
   -- Critical Care -- Edwards plans to continue to distinguish its leadership 
      position in Critical Care technologies with the ongoing rollout of its 
      HemoSphere monitoring platform and further expansion of its Enhanced 
      Surgical Recovery programs. The company is also pioneering a new 
      predictive monitoring category with the planned U.S. launch of its Acumen 
      Hypotension Prediction Indicator in 2018. 

During the conference, Edwards' management will reaffirm the company's financial guidance for 2017 and provide guidance for 2018.

[1]  Guidance for sales, underlying sales growth and adjusted earnings per 
     share is provided on a non-GAAP basis, adjusted for special items 
     discussed below, due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting such 
     items. The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of the 
     non-GAAP guidance to comparable GAAP measures due to the unknown effect, 
     timing, and potential significance of special charges or gains, and 
     management's inability to forecast charges associated with future 
     transactions and initiatives. 
 
[2]  "Underlying" growth rates are non-GAAP items and in this press release 
     exclude foreign exchange fluctuations, sales return reserves associated 
     with THVT product upgrades, the positive impact of 2017 THVT stocking 
     sales in Germany, the negative impact of de-stocking, and other special 
     items. 
 
[3]  "Adjusted earnings per share" is a non-GAAP item computed on a diluted 
     basis and in this press release excludes impairment of long-lived assets, 
     intellectual property litigation expenses, amortization of intellectual 
     property, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities 
     arising from acquisitions, realignment expenses, the positive impact of 
     2017 THVT stocking sales in Germany, and the negative impact of 
     de-stocking, and other special items. 
 
[4]  "Free cash flow" is defined as cash flow from operating activities less 
     capital expenditures. For 2017, this figure excludes the impact of the 
     Neovasc  litigation payment, net of the Edwards Foundation contribution.
