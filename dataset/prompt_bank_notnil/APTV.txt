The companies plan to produce kits that can be installed on existing cars to enable them to operate autonomously, said Raj Kapoor, Lyft’s chief strategy officer. Retrofitting cars, as opposed to building new ones, could help the company produce autonomous vehicles more quickly and inexpensively, he said.

The announcement Wednesday adds to Lyft’s extensive roster of self-driving-vehicle partners, which includes Ford Motor Co.; General Motors Co.; Alphabet’s Waymo; nuTonomy Inc.; Tata Motors Ltd.’s Jaguar Land Rover; and Aptiv PLC, formerly Delphi.

That stands in contrast to rival Uber Technologies Inc., which is primarily developing self-driving technology on its own rather than forging partnerships.

Lyft’s goal is to plug autonomous cars from partners into its network. The Magna deal is Lyft’s first involving a large-scale manufacturer, and the kits they develop could be sold to auto makers, ride-hailing networks or even drivers themselves, Lyft said.

Magna assembles vehicles for other auto makers, and manufactures parts such as seating and powertrains. Apple Inc. had considered Magna as its manufacturer when it explored the idea of a car, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.

Last summer, Lyft formed a self-driving-vehicle division with a new office in the heart of Silicon Valley. Swamy Kotagiri, Magna’s chief technology officer, said the Canadian company will move some staff to Lyft’s Palo Alto offices.

The companies declined to provide some details about the agreement, including the size of Magna’s stake, how long the partnership will last, or what each side contractually agreed to deliver. If Lyft ultimately uses technology the companies jointly develop, it must rely on Magna to manufacture it, Mr. Kotagiri said.

Magna or Lyft could choose to sell the kits to other auto manufacturers, Mr. Kapoor said. “Everything we develop in autonomous vehicle technology, Magna can spread across the technology industry,” he said.

Lyft expects the partnership to accelerate the adoption and reliability of driverless vehicles, which it hopes will reduce the need for customers to shuttle around town using their own cars. Like Uber, Lyft is still unprofitable, and executives of the two companies believe fully self-driving vehicles will greatly reduce costs.

Still, driverless autos face an uphill climb. It could take years for tech companies to develop fully autonomous vehicles that need no driver involvement, particularly in difficult scenarios involving snow, rain or hilly terrain.

And while regulators allow some testing, any self-driving technology will have to satisfy concerns about safety and reliability. A few companies today offer rides in autonomous vehicles that have a human driver behind the wheel for when things go awry.

Lyft made its first big push in self-driving vehicles in early 2016, when it took a $500 million investment from GM that it said would lead to autonomous taxis on the road by spring of 2017. Lyft has a trial under way in Las Vegas and another is planned for Boston, but hasn’t yet put GM autonomous vehicles onto its network for customer use.
