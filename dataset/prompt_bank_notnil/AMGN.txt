Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc . (NASDAQ: FPRX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing immune modulators and precision therapies for solid tumor cancers, today announced results for the third quarter of 2020 in addition to providing an update on the company's recent activities.

"We look forward to achieving three milestones before the end of the year that will inform future development of our pipeline," said Tom Civik , Chief Executive Officer of Five Prime Therapeutics . "Before year end, we expect to report top-line data from the FIGHT Phase 2 trial in front-line gastric cancer. We also expect to have enough FPT155 monotherapy data to inform next steps for the program, and we will present the first data set from our anti-CCR8 program at the upcoming SITC annual meeting. The Five Prime team has done an excellent job advancing our clinical and research programs despite the many challenges we have all confronted this year."

Third Quarter 2020 Milestones

Clinical Pipeline:

Bemarituzumab (anti-FGFR2b) is a first-in-class isoform-selective antibody with enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) being studied in the FIGHT trial as a targeted therapy for front-line FGFR2b+/HER2- gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer. 


   -- The company expects to report top-line data before year end from the 
      double-blind Phase 2 FIGHT study where all 155 patients receive standard 
      mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy and are randomized to receive bemarituzumab or 
      placebo. 
 
   -- The primary endpoint of the Phase 2 FIGHT trial is progression-free 
      survival (PFS), and a secondary endpoint is overall survival (OS). 

FPT155 (CD80-Fc) is a first-in-class CD80-Fc fusion protein that directly engages CD28 and binds to CTLA-4, promoting CD8 T cell activation in the tumor microenvironment. 


   -- Patients with warm/hot tumor types continue to be enrolled at the 560mg 
      dose in the ongoing Phase 1a/1b trial, with the aim of generating early 
      clinical data at a potentially active dose to determine next steps for 
      this program. 
 
   -- The first cohort has been cleared and the second cohort is open for 
      enrollment in a dose escalation of FPT155 and pembrolizumab in patients 
      with non-small cell lung cancer. 

FPA157 (anti-CCR8) is a novel antibody directed to CCR8, a promising immuno-oncology target that is expressed by a highly immunosuppressive population of T regulatory cells within tumors. Eliminating CCR8-expressing T regulatory cells is anticipated to reduce immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment and promote development of anti-tumor responses. 


   -- The company's FPA157 late-breaking abstract has been accepted for a 
      poster presentation at the 2020 Society of Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) 
       Annual Meeting. 
 
   -- The company expects to submit an IND application for this program in the 
      first half of 2022. 

Summary of Third Quarter 2020 Financial Results and Cash Guidance:

Cash Position: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $112.9 million as of September 30, 2020 compared to $157.9 million as of December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily attributed to quarterly operating expenses that exceeded quarterly revenues.

Revenue: Collaboration and license revenue for the third quarter of 2020 decreased by $0.9 million, or 31%, to $2.0 million from $2.9 million for the third quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in revenue pursuant to progress achieved toward satisfying performance obligations under the company's November 2014 cabiralizumab collaboration agreement with BMS. The decrease was partially offset by higher collaboration revenue from Zai Lab that resulted from the company's decision to amend the FIGHT trial to a Phase 2 design.

R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2020 decreased by $5.5 million, or 20%, to $21.4 million from $26.9 million for the third quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower compensation costs resulting from the October 2019 restructuring, lower clinical trial expense and manufacturing costs, along with lower allocated costs, bioanalytics and central lab costs, and a decrease in costs related to preclinical programs. These reductions were partially offset by an impairment charge on right-of-use assets and other fixed assets related to the sublease of a portion of the company's facility, as well as an increase in companion diagnostics costs related to bemarituzumab.

G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2020 increased by $0.5 million, or 4%, to $13.7 million from $13.2 million for the third quarter of 2019. The increase was primarily due to an impairment charge taken in the third quarter on the right-of-use asset and other fixed assets related to the sublease of a portion of the company's facility, as well as higher allocated costs that were offset by lower compensation, depreciation, and other miscellaneous general and administrative costs.

Net Loss: Net loss for the third quarter of 2020 was $26.4 million, or $0.74 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $36.1 million, or $1.03 per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of 2019.

Shares Outstanding: Total shares outstanding were 35,620,167 as of September 30, 2020.

Cash Guidance: Five Prime expects full-year 2020 net cash used in operating activities to be between $70 and $75 million and has raised guidance to end 2020 with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities between $100 and $105 million.
