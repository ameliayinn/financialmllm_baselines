Wednesday's results mark the first time since the annual tests began in 2011 that all firms passed. That reflects a turning point and could herald a return to precrisis days when banks were reliable dividend payers and shareholders flocked to them.

On average, the companies requested payouts that are near 100% of their expected earnings over the next year, up from 65% last year, senior Fed officials said.

That could provide a durable pillar of support for higher bank stock prices. Those soared following President Donald Trump 's victory but largely have treaded water so far in 2017 amid lackluster economic indicators and political defeats for the White House.

In after-hours trading Wednesday, following the stress-test results, several banks saw their shares increase by more than 1%, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc ., Morgan Stanley , Bank of America Corp ., J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc .

Analysts expect several banks, including Citigroup , to seek Fed approval to pay out more than they earn over the next year. Many banks will announce their new dividends and buyback targets Wednesday afternoon.

The results suggest that banks have gotten better at cracking the Fed's methodology, which executives have in the past described as a "black box." Morgan Stanley , Goldman Sachs and State Street Corp . came within tenths of a percentage point of falling below one of the Fed's minimum capital ratios.

Such signs indicate the industry is emboldened to seek higher payouts -- and that the Fed is inclined to approve them. That would reduce capital levels, which executives say have discouraged lending and crimped profitability.

"The absolute minimum is there won't be increased capital in these businesses," Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman said earlier this month. "There shouldn't be and there won't be. Now it's a question of how quickly and how it gets peeled back."

This is the second set of stress-test results released by the Fed over the past week, assessing whether officials believe the biggest banks could continue to lend even during a deep recession.

Last week, the largest U.S. banks breezed through the first round of tests with capital ratios well above the Fed's set minimum, when put through a hypothetical recession that included falling commercial real-estate prices, 10% unemployment and recessions in Europe and Japan.

"I'm pleased that the [stress-test] process has motivated all of the largest banks to achieve healthy capital levels and most to substantially improve their capital planning processes," Fed governor Jerome Powell said in a statement Wednesday.

The largest firms, however, "continue to fall short of supervisory expectations" in a few areas, including maintaining accurate data and identifying risks in new products or underwriting standards, the Fed's report said.

One worrisome spot is credit cards. Two of the largest stand-alone issuers, Capital One Financial Corp . and American Express , revised their payout requests downward after receiving the results of the stress test's first part last week.

American Express 's original request would have dropped it below one of the Fed's minimum capital ratios.

Capital One 's wouldn't have; it wasn't immediately clear why the firm took the so-called mulligan. The Fed approved Capital One 's plan, but only contingent on the firm resubmitting within six months to address what the regulator called "material weaknesses."

Credit-card defaults, which had fallen in recent years near record lows, are now on the rise, and were a central focus of the Fed officials in designing this year's stress tests. Last week's results forecast $100 billion in credit-card losses across big banks, making that category the worst-performing type of loan.

Born of the 2008 financial meltdown, the stress tests have come to command bankers' and investors' attention each year. Executives manage with the tests in mind and have collectively spent billions of dollars to develop risk-management systems to meet the Fed's expectations.

This year's passing grades suggest that those efforts have paid off. Banks today are better capitalized and more conservatively managed than in the years before the financial crisis, and have better insight into risks lurking in their own books.

In a nod to that progress, the Fed has made changes to the exams. This year, only 13 banks considered especially large and complex had to pass a qualitative exam of their risk-management abilities. Others faced only numerical assessments.

Some executives still say the Fed's process is too opaque and stringent and have complained that the higher capital required by them has choked lending and harmed the economy.

Mr. Gorman of Morgan Stanley , whose stress-test submission this year ran 44,999 pages, said recently that the Fed could make "simple changes" that "could be very powerful for bank stocks."

For example, the stress tests assume that, even in a severe downturn, banks would keep buying back stock at the same level they did in better times. For Morgan Stanley , that translates into nearly $8 billion in capital it must currently hold, about 11% of its total.

The Trump administration has been sympathetic to bankers' complaints and recently recommended additional changes to the tests, such as requiring capital-return approvals every other year rather than annually.
