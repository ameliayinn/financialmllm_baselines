Music-Rights Manager

Blackstone Group LP is getting into the music business.

The New York private-equity firm is in advanced talks to buy music-rights manager Sesac, according to people familiar with the matter. The purchase price couldn't be learned, but the Nashville company in 2013 sold a 75% stake to its current owner, private-equity firm Rizvi Traverse Management LLC, for $600 million.

The deal would mark the first-ever music-industry buyout by Blackstone.

In Sesac, Blackstone is betting on a little-known but important player in the music business. The company licenses song rights for clients including Bob Dylan, Neil Diamond and Rush to radio stations and others. It was founded in 1930.

MARATHON PETROLEUM

Company Acts

After Elliott Criticism

Marathon Petroleum Corp. announced plans to accelerate so-called drop-down deals and conduct a strategic review of its Speedway assets, months after hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. raised concerns.

Marathon said it would significantly accelerate a drop-down of assets to MPLX LP, a master limited partnership formed by Marathon Petroleum.

The company also said that a committee of the board will conduct a review of Speedway, its company-owned and operated convenience stores and gas stations. Marathon Petroleum Chairman Gary Heminger said the moves will unlock shareholder value. Elliott said Tuesday that it was pleased with the actions.

SAMSON RESOURCES

Junior Creditors

Face a Deadline

Samson Resources Corp. has given junior creditors until Friday to stand down from a bankruptcy-court confrontation over the oil-and-gas company's future, warning that the $168.5 million junior creditors are being offered will decline if they press ahead with a rival chapter 11 exit plan.

Talks in 2016 brought the Oklahoma company and the committee representing unsecured creditors close to a deal that would allow the company to exit bankruptcy peacefully.

Instead of an all-out liquidation, Samson's creditors agreed to take the cash. However, Samson and the committee are at odds over provisions that could trigger a sale of remaining assets, Samson's lawyers said in court papers.

Lawyers for the official creditors committee couldn't immediately be reached Tuesday to respond.
