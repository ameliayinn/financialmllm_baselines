Lockheed Martin Corp., the world's largest defense contractor by sales, opens the reporting season before the bell Tuesday. Investors' focus remains on the planned rise in F-35 combat jet production and Lockheed's efforts to boost the profitability of the plane while reducing its cost following White House intervention.

-- Budget Black Hole

Defense companies are working in the dark. A temporary budget runs out Friday and will likely be replaced by another that freezes spending at prior-year levels for several months, assuming a government shutdown is avoided.

-- Cheaper by the Dozen

The number of big contracts being awarded has shrunk as budgets tightened, but companies are also becoming pickier. Northrop Grumman Corp., which reports Wednesday, pulled out of the contest to build new Air Force trainers, and, like others, is guarded about the Pentagon procurement apparatus.

-- Something's Got to Give

General Dynamics Corp., which reports Wednesday, has been by far the best-performing defense firm since the presidential election, boosted by rhetoric around expanding the Navy and a slightly brighter outlook for its Gulfstream business jets.

-- Export Potential

Congress was notified of overseas defense deals valued at $62.5 billion last year. High-end equipment such as the missile-defense systems made by Raytheon Co., which reports Thursday, as well as combat jets and munitions, remain in heavy demand.
