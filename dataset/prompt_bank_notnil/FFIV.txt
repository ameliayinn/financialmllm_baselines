SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 23, 2015-- 

Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE: ANET) today announced CloudVision(R) , a network-wide approach for workload orchestration and workflow automation delivering a turnkey solution for cloud networking.

Arista has pioneered the SDN approach in the networking industry with its software defined cloud networking, built on top of Arista EOS with programmable interfaces, publish-subscribe state separation, resilient fault containment and self-healing attributes. CloudVision extends the same architectural approach across the network for state, topology, monitoring and visibility. This enables enterprises to move to cloud-class automation without needing any significant internal development.

"Today more than ever, customers are empowered with software-defined technologies from leaders such as VMware and Arista Networks to gain the agility they need to respond to market opportunities and a rapidly changing business environment," said Hatem Naguib, Vice President, Networking and Security at VMware. "Through interoperability between our portfolio of software-defined data center offerings and the new Arista CloudVision solution, our mutual customers can move forward with confidence to achieve their IT goals of a more automated, secure, and highly available data center that drives business value."

Controller Integration with Key Partners

A fundamental piece of cloud automation is the customers' ability to orchestrate workloads across their physical and virtual infrastructure. CloudVision is the platform for deeper integration with SDN controllers from Arista's ecosystem partner community.

"Microsoft and Arista have a long history of partnering on industry-leading data center solutions, and we are committed to helping customers leverage software defined technologies to be more agile and efficient in today's cloud-first world," said Mike Schutz, General Manager, Cloud Platform, Microsoft. "CloudVision's open and programmable underlay make it an ideal complement to Microsoft Cloud Platform solutions, which will enable us to jointly help even more customers transform their data center for the cloud era."

CloudVision's abstraction of the physical network to this broader, network-wide perspective allows for a more efficient approach for several operational use-cases, including the following highlights: 


   -- Centralized representation of distributed network state, allowing for a 
      single point of integration and network-wide visibility and analytics 
 
   -- Controller agnostic support for physical and virtual workload 
      orchestration through open APIs such as OVSDB, JSON and OpenStack 
      plugins. 
 
   -- Turn-key workflow automation for zero touch provisioning, configuration 
      management and network-wide upgrades and rollback. 
 
   -- Compliance dashboard for security, audit and patch management 
 
   -- Real-time Streaming for telemetry and network analytics, a modern 
      approach to replace legacy polling per device. 
 
   -- Provides visibility and troubleshooting for underlay and overlay networks 

Availability

Arista CloudVision is available now as a software subscription, expanding Arista's existing software subscription offerings. Pricing starts at $295/device per month.
