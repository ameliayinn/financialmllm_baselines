Energy giants Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, both of which supported the agreement, may get hit on the margin, even though the conventional wisdom has it that they would be winners.

Meanwhile, future greenhouse gas emissions may not be too different from what they might have been under a Clinton administration. Market forces, such as cheap natural gas, will have a bigger effect than the agreement would have.

Meanwhile, U.S. regulations aimed at meeting Paris goals weren't burdensome for all. Exxon Mobil, for example, stood to benefit. Stricter U.S. climate rules may have produced a slight drag on the demand for oil, a global commodity of which Exxon is the sixth-largest producer. But it would have been a boon to U.S. natural gas, a mostly landlocked market where Exxon is the top producer.

Furthermore, rules mandating the capture of greenhouse gas methane, which escapes some U.S. oil wells, hurts smaller competitors far more than Exxon or its peers. Big oil's wells are in large fields near pipelines where the methane already can be captured and turned into fuels.

Finally, Exxon shareholders, a majority of whom voted this week on a nonbinding proposal calling for it to reveal the impact of complying with climate-change rules, might have been placated.

The trajectory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions under President Donald Trump's policies may be surprisingly mild.

Under the auspices of the Paris agreement, the Obama administration pledged to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to between 26% and 28% below the 2005 level by 2025. Much of that already is well under way, though, as a result of factors outside of any president's control: slower growth following the financial crisis, the shale gas revolution that has replaced a third of coal use and shifting driving habits.

The Rhodium Group calculates that the U.S. still will come close to a 17% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions as soon as 2020 but then stall.

Other policies will do relatively little to meet climate goals. For example, state and federal tax breaks encourage electric-vehicle sales, but they are just 1% of all passenger vehicles sold today. Even if they reach 5% of all vehicles on the road by 2025, the reduction in total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions would be about half a percentage point, holding all else equal.

Other Obama policies may not have been as effective as they seemed. Natural gas should continue to replace older coal plants as long as the relative prices of the fuels remain around today's levels, though perhaps more slowly than before. And auto makers would likely have negotiated loopholes in efficiency rules.

There is little doubt that some U.S. industries can celebrate, but governments around the world, and even in some U.S. states, may force U.S. companies to adhere to stricter rules anyway.
