0955 ET - Negative rates are likely to stay off the table at the Bank of England 's Thursday policy meeting, given their adverse side effects and the limited pass-through from recent rate cuts, says Pimco. "Negative rates seem therefore unlikely in today's situation, or even following another adverse shock," says the asset manager. "They would instead be more likely--though still not our base case--in a new steady state in which inflation has settled below target, activity growing at decent pace, and with no immediate pressure on bank balance sheets," it says.

0947 ET - Expeditors International of Washington tops Wall Street predictions with a 19.4% gain in net profit in 3Q to $191.3M. EPS of $1.12 compares to $0.92 a year ago, and stems from a 19% jump in yearly revenue growth, to $2.46B. Analyst consensus estimates were for EPS of $0.97 and $2.36B in revenue. Gross airfreight revenue soars 52.8% to $1.09B on tight capacity, as the freight forwarder chartered more aircraft, "resulting in higher average buy and sell rates," says CEO Jeffrey Musser .

0944 ET - A prolonged institutional jam following the U.S. elections would delay fiscal stimulus needed to further strengthen the nascent economic recovery, Axel Botte, strategist at Ostrum Asset Managers, says. The latest polls point to a broad victory for Biden and a Democratic majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate but several battleground states remain toss-up cases and the outcome may well be contested by the Republican Party for days or even weeks, the strategist says. "A blue-wave scenario may imply a significant change in equity market dynamics," Botte says, explaining that tax changes proposed by Joe Biden --including the introduction of a minimum tax rate and lower allowance on intangibles--would hit technology giants more than most corporations.

0943 ET - AstraZeneca 's oncology segment will be in focus when the U.K. pharmaceutical giant reports its 3Q results on Thursday, Berenberg says. The company generates around 40% of its revenue from oncology, and there will be interest in understanding the impact of reduced cancer screening and diagnosis on treatment rates during the coronavirus pandemic, Berenberg says. Product sales are expected to rise 7% for the quarter, with strong performances from key growth drivers Tagrisso, Imfinzi, Lynparza, Calquence and Fasenra, Berenberg says. However, some pressures in China are forecast to provide a drag on growth, the brokerage says. (adria.calatayud@dowjones.com)

0923 ET - Rail provider Canadian Pacific says it shipped a record amount of grains in October, totaling 3.04M metric tons--the first time ever that Canadian Pacific has shipped over 3M tons of grain in a month. The company says flows of grains to ports has been "very strong," necessitating investment in new hopper cars. The situation appears to be similar in the US, with the USDA reporting that rail shipments of grains in the US were 24% higher in mid-October than they were at the same time last year. For grains traders counting on strong export demand to support prices, Canadian Pacific 's announcement is supportive. Pre-market, CBOT grain futures are up, with corn up 0.7%, soybeans rising 1.2%, and wheat gaining 0.9%. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com; @kirkmaltais)

0922 ET - San Antonio-based Valero is really good at operating refineries safely and efficiently -- perhaps even the best -- but analysts at Goldman Sachs say the evidence keeps piling up that the business model for so-called merchant refiners like Valero simply isn't getting the job done these days. "We reiterate our preference for Diversified Refiners [like Phillips 66 , Marathon and Par Pacific] versus more Merchant Refiners given challenging refining fundamentals as well as a below-historical-average view on refining margins going forward," they say, noting also that "diversified refiners have more exposure to higher multiple businesses including midstream, retail/marketing, and chemicals." Diversifieds have outperformed merchant peers 28% the last six months, they add. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

0915 ET - Spirit AeroSystems provides one of the best guides to overall supply chain health, given deliveries by Airbus and Boeing deliveries are so disconnected from production, mainly by pandemic-related issues. Spirit provided 100 more shipsets than Boeing delivered completed jets through 3Q, with a gap of 83 for Airbus aircraft. Cash advances at those shipment rates are crucial for providing Spirit, and the broader supply chain, with liquidity. Shares up 1.4% in pre open trade, in line with the broader market.

0914 ET - Touchstone Exploration 's wide-ranging operational program can go forward at full steam with its latest capital raise, Canaccord Genuity says. The brokerage notes that the oil and gas company raised $30 million to fund continuing exploration, development and production on its 80%-owned Ortoire license in Trinidad. "The success so far has not just provided clear line of sight to early cashflow from the current batch of discoveries, but those results have opened up the potential for an extensive long-term exploration and development program," Canaccord says. Canaccord maintains a speculative buy on the stock with a target price of 135 pence. (adriano.marchese@wsj.com)

0911 ET - Italian sports-car maker Ferrari again showed the dependability of its business model, analysts at Citi say, after the company reported strong third-quarter results. Quarterly EBIT of EUR222 million beat consensus estimates of around EUR195 million, the analysts say, though they point out expectations had been reduced ahead of the results. Citi now expects mid-single digit upgrades to full-year consensus estimates for Ferrari. "Looking at the areas of surprise in the results, it was again mix which drove numbers with the [Ferrari Monza] SP1 and SP2 helping offset the volume declines," they say. Shares in Ferrari are trading up 4.3% at EUR164.05. (kim.richters@wsj.com)

0907 ET - Ryman Hospitality's 3Q revenue comes in more than 80% below the level in the year-ago period as the REIT logs a quarterly loss of $2.14 a share. Still, the company says it has seen some smaller instances of group travel returning, adding that corporate customers have appeared eager to resume in-person gatherings as public-health conditions allow. Industry analysts have said they expect that as travel recovers from the pandemic, leisure travel will likely return faster than business customers for hotels and airlines. CEO Colin Reed says Ryman is also focused on drawing leisure travelers looking for short-range road trips. At $39.79, Ryman shares are down more than 54% year to date, mirroring declines across the industry. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)
