1137 ET - While most US companies are rejoicing over lower tax rates, Eaton is among those facing a bigger tax bill from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The company relocated its corporate headquarters to Ireland a few years ago from Cleveland to reduce its taxes. But the new tax legislation is designed to discourage those moves. The maker of electrical gear and truck transmissions, anticipates logging a $90M-$110M one-time tax charge in 4Q that will likely shave EPS by about 20 cents. Roughly half of the expense is related to the recalibration of US deferred tax balances and the other half is for taxation of unremitted earnings of non-US operations owned by Eaton's US subsidiaries. Eaton expects its effective tax rate in 2018 to increase to 14%-16% from an earlier forecast of 11%-13%. (Robert.tita@wsj.com)

0808 ET - US stock futures are higher as Wall Street heads into its last trading day of 2017, a year that exceeded the expectations of many investors with the S&P up 20%, the Dow up 25% and the Nasdaq up 29%. In Europe the Stoxx Europe 600 is bobbing between small gains and losses in thin trading ahead of the New Year holiday. Overall, the MSCI AC World ex-USA Index, which tracks stocks across developed and emerging markets outside the US, is poised to end 2017 with gains of roughly 24% helped by an upswing in growth around the world. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury is at 2.428% ahead of an early 2pm ET close for bond trading here in the US ahead of the long holiday weekend. S&P futures up 9.75 points.

0731 ET - Goldman Sachs will take $5B in earnings charges attributable to the US tax overhaul. Goldman says two-thirds of the charge stems from a repatriation tax it will pay on cash it is bringing back from overseas operations. (That tax is actually lower under the new system, but the reduction encourages companies to repatriate cash they might otherwise have left abroad.) Goldman is also taking an unspecified write-down of its deferred tax assets, which are past losses that can be used to defray future tax bills. Many banks that had near-death experiences during the crisis--Bank of America has more than $19B of them in its pocket--will have to write down these credits, which are now worth less after the tax overhaul reduced the headline corporate tax from 35% to 21%.

0323 ET - The dollar has eased further so far in Friday's global session, though not like the selloff seen during Asia's afternoon yesterday. It's widely down 0.1-0.2%, with the euro at $1.1960 and the pound at $1.3475. The WSJ Dollar Index was at 3-month lows late Thursday in New York and it's dropped more than 7% this year, on pace for its biggest decline since 2007. "2017 has been marked by persistent dollar weakness, and with year-end flows easing it will close out the year in the same way," notes BK Asset Management. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)
