1028 ET - The pace of US oil exports accelerated this fall thanks to cheap tanker economics, says David St Amand of Navigistics Consulting. The US is in the rare situation of being both a major crude oil importer and a major exporter, which means tankers can deliver Mideast crude to the US Gulf Coast and then refill and move to other markets in Latin America or Europe. Those so-called "backhaul" and "triangular" routes have helped reduce tanker rates from the US. For instance, Mideast-to-Japan rates are now at WS70 (or 70% of the Worldscale flat tanker rate) while Mideast to the US Gulf is WS28. Current shipping costs from Corpus Christi, Texas to Rotterdam runs between $1.12 to $2.30 a barrel, depending on the size of the oil tanker. From Corpus to Korea it's between $2.90 and $4.30 a barrel, and from Corpus to Singapore it's between $2.66 to $5.13 a barrel. (lynn.cook@wsj.com; @LynnJCook)

1025 ET - Leonard Riggio , chairman of Barnes & Noble, and the bookseller's largest single private shareholder, on December 1 bought 1M shares on the open market priced between $6.575-$6.95. He now owns 14.1M shares, or 19.3% of the common, compared with 13.1M, or 18%, as of August 7th. In November an activist investor proposed taking Barnes & Noble private; Riggio at the time said he wasn't interested. A spokeswoman for Barnes & Noble says that the recent stock purchases were not related to the activist investor. "This is about his faith in the company and the future of the business," she says. Barnes & Noble shares up 2.6% to $6.88. (Jeffrey.Trachtenberg@wsj.com ; @JeffreyT1)

1016 ET - Comcast CFO Mike Cavanagh does not address talks with Twenty-First Century Fox to acquire several Fox assets including its television and movie studios and its international platforms Sky in Europe and Star in India during an interview at an investor conference Monday. At the UBS conference, Cavanagah says Comcast is happy with its current assets, which include over 20M cable subscribers as well as NBCUniversal , home to the NBC broadcast network and several cable channels including USA and MSNBC. Cavanagh did say the company is always asking, "are there things out there we could do that would create value for shareholders." Asked after his session by a reporter about the status of talks with Twenty-First Century Fox , he declined to comment. 21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal parent News Corp . share common ownership.

1015 ET - The broad rally that's taken the Dow Jones Industrial Average up nearly 300 points Monday has left behind one sector: technology. Shares of technology companies in the S&P 500 were recently down 0.8%, the only group of the broad index's 11 sectors trading in negative territory. The losses weighed on the Nasdaq Composite, which edged down 0.1% as the Dow industrials jumped 1.2%. While the Republican plan to cut corporate tax rates should lift earnings growth broadly, helping US stocks, some analysts have said it could also spur a rotation out of outperforming names into relative underperformers. Those analysts believe tech stocks in the S&P 500, which have nearly doubled the broad index's gains this year, are vulnerable to a pullback. (akane.otani@wsj.com; @akaneotani)

1011 ET - CVS's $69B deal for Aetna couldn't come at a better time for Goldman Sachs , whose lead in the annual M&A rankings--a deep fount of bragging rights on Wall Street--was looking a bit thin heading into year-end. As of Friday, Goldman had a lead of $50B over chief rival Morgan Stanley in global deals and $30B in the US, about half its margin this time last year. Goldman advised CVS while both Morgan Stanly and JPMorgan were absent from the deal, which was heavy on boutique advisers. That should cement Goldman's lock on the top spot for 2017. The bank will pick up extra fees for helping to line up $49B in financing, a coup in its effort to be more of a takeover lender. (liz.hoffman@wsj.com; @lizrhoffman)

1001 ET - Strong employment gains and a gradual pickup in inflation will compel Bank of Canada to raise rates in 2018 by more than the markets anticipate, says the economics team at National Bank Financial. The firm has a solid track record on the rate outlook, as it was among the first in Canada to predict rate rises this year when most forecasters anticipated they wouldn't start until next year. NBF says BoC "just cannot ignore the strong labor market," which added nearly 80K jobs in November, and the jobless rate fell to a near-decade low and below the 6% level. NBF adds that it "would not be surprised," if USDCAD revisits the 1.25 level in early 2018 as BoC again embraces a hawkish tilt. (paul.vieira@wsj.com, @paulvieira)

0956 ET - CVS says it will move quickly to pay down $45B in debt it's taking on to acquire Aetna . The company says it will suspend share buybacks and keep its dividend flat as it works to pay off debt. Aetna also will stop share buybacks, and the joint company will refrain from making acquisitions for a time. (sharon.terlep@wsj.com)

0951 ET - US government bond yields rise as investors speculate that some version of the Republican plan to revamp taxes with lower rates for corporations will gain final passage, boosting growth and locking in higher equity prices. Investors also sell bonds overnight amid strength in global stock markets. Optimism is likely to remain tempered by the recognition that Congress must pass some sort of spending plan to fund the government after existing spending authorization expires December 8. After that, there's also the need to increase the debt ceiling. Aside from political considerations, many investors will be waiting for the December 8 jobs report. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield rises to 2.397% from 2.363% on Friday. (Daniel.kruger@wsj.com)

0948 ET - Boeing and other aerospace stocks make strong early gains, lifted by proposed U.S. tax reform as well as IATA's report of a 7.2% bump in passenger traffic during October. Boeing rises around 2%, with commercial aero shares outperforming defense stocks, the latter weighed slightly by the prospect of another short-term Pentagon budget when the current one runs out Friday. Tax experts said the impact on aerospace will hinge on reconciling language on a proposed foreign excise tax. (doug.cameron@wsj.com; @dougcameron)

0943 ET - Shares of banks are rallying shortly after the opening bell, lifted by the latest signs of progress on a US tax overhaul. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index of large US lenders was recently up 2.3%, on course for its fifth consecutive session of gains. JPMorgan rose 3%, Morgan Stanley added 2.1% and Goldman Sachs rose 1.4%. Corporate tax cuts could boost earnings growth and lend additional fuel to the US stock rally, analysts say. Shares of banks, which some analysts say pay among the highest effective tax rates of any major industry, have rallied in recent sessions as Republicans have drawn closer to pushing a tax bill to the White House.

0942 ET - CVS says it hopes to retain Aetna 's executives after the deal closes--an important question, as the drugstore company has no bench of managers with experience running a health insurer. The insurer's CEO, Mark Bertolini , won't retain a management role, though he will join the combined company's board. While offering no specifics about retention packages, CVS CEO Larry Merlo says he's "confident that we'll be able to work out the specifics so that there are many of those individuals that will want to continue on and be a part of this exciting journey." He notes that Aetna will be run as a separate business unit within CVS and plays up his plans to consult with the current Aetna CEO and "continue to pick his brain." (anna.mathews@wsj.com)
