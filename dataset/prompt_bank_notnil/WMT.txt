"A lot more retailers are offering all the convenient options this year," said Amit Sharma, chief executive of Narvar, a technology firm that helps retailers including Gap Inc., Sephora and Yeti Holdings Inc. with shipping and tracking purchases and returns.

Online retailer Amazon.com Inc. said it has expanded options for in-person returns this year, with a network of 2,000 "locker" locations, including 400 at its Whole Foods stores, where customers can drop off items to be returned. Amazon also partnered with Kohl's Corp. stores in Chicago and Los Angeles, which are accepting returns of Amazon goods bought online.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is touting its Mobile Express Returns kiosks, located in its stores, where it says customers can complete the return process in less than five minutes and receive a refund within a day or so. They can also print a shipping label online and drop off merchandise at a designated shipping location.

Target Corp. offers similar in-store and drop-off options, and like Wal-Mart doesn't charge for returns. Kohl's and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. have comparable policies, but don't cover the cost of return shipping.

As shoppers increasingly turned to the internet for their holiday purchases this year, they were more likely to patronize e-commerce shops with speedy delivery and easy returns, analysts say. Online holiday sales are expected to top $107 billion this year, an increase of 13.8% from 2016, according to Adobe.

Returns have become a "battleground" among online retailers trying to attract and retain customers, said Tobin Moore, chief executive of Optoro Inc., a logistics provider that helps companies like Target and Best Buy Co. process and resell returned merchandise.

Mr. Moore estimates that goods purchased online are three times more likely to be returned as goods bought in a physical store. In total for this season, he said roughly $90 billion in holiday merchandise will be returned over the next few weeks, with more than one-third of it coming back before the new year.

With higher volumes of merchandise coming back through a wider variety of channels, analysts say handling the reverse supply chain can get costly.

"Those returns require extra manual work," said David Bassuk, a retail consultant with AlixPartners LLP. Every item that comes back has to be checked for damage.

One of the ways retailers lower those costs is to encourage shoppers to return items directly to a store. Items returned to the store cost a retailer roughly $3 to process and are available for resale within a day, according to AlixPartners. Items shipped back to a distribution center or third-party logistics provider cost $6 or more to process and take at least four days before they are available for resale.

Retailers see another benefit to in-store returns: customers sometimes make additional purchases after bringing back unwanted gifts.

For shoppers who choose to ship goods back, parcel carriers have readied their networks for the holiday season's aftermath. FedEx Corp. told investors in a conference call last week that it has 10,000 locations -- including Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. stores, grocers Kroger Co. and Albertsons Cos. and its own FedEx Office storefronts -- where customers can drop off items for returns. Rajesh Subramaniam, FedEx's chief marketing officer, said that "the business of returns continues to grow in scale and complexity, especially for retailers."
