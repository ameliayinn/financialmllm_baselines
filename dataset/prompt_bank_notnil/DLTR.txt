Sales at Discounter

Dollar Tree Inc.'s profit shot up 41% in the latest quarter and margins expanded amid more shoppers coming to the retailer's stores -- and spending more.

Chief Executive Bob Sasser called the market for discount retail "the most attractive sector" of a struggling industry. Like rival Dollar General Corp., Dollar Tree generally has benefited from rising wages among core customers.

Same-store sales at Dollar Tree rose 2.3%, and same-store sales at its Family Dollar locations edged up 0.2%.

Over all, for the quarter ended Jan. 28, Dollar Tree reported net income of $321.8 million, or $1.36 a share, compared with $229 million, or 97 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Sales rose 5% to $5.64 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected per-share earnings of $1.32 on $5.62 billion in revenue.

BEST BUY

Shortages Crimped

Holiday Performance

Best Buy Co. couldn't keep its shelves stocked with enough highly sought-after electronics during the crucial holiday season, triggering a surprise drop in revenue and a warning that shortages could continue in the first half of the year.

The retailer had previously said it expected to lose about $200 million because of Samsung Electronics Co.'s recall of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. But Best Buy Chief Executive Hubert Joly said in a call with analysts Wednesday that the other shortages "felt unprecedented," accounting for another $100 million to $200 million in lost revenue. Best Buy said it anticipated shortages to continue to affect revenue in the first half.

Best Buy earned $607 million, or $1.91 a share in the fourth quarter, up from $479 million, or $1.40 a share, a year ago. Revenue slipped 1%, to $13.48 billion.

MYLAN

EpiPen Controversy

Appears to Fade

Mylan NV's profit more than doubled in the final quarter of the year as the drugmaker posted double-digit sales gains across regions.

During the quarter, Mylan seemed to move past its EpiPen pricing controversy. After broad criticism, Mylan in December launched a generic version of the lifesaving drug at half the price.

In all for the three months ended Dec. 31, Mylan earned $417.5 million, or 78 cents a share, up from $194.6 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier.

Adjusted earnings climbed to $1.57 a share. Revenue surged 31% to $3.27 billion. Analysts were looking for $1.42 in adjusted earnings on $3.17 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters.

BCBG MAX AZRIA GROUP

Apparel Retailer

Seeks Chapter 11

Women's apparel retailer BCBG Max Azria Group LLC sought chapter 11 protection Tuesday with plans to pull back on brick-and-mortar stores as more shoppers head online.

BCBG, whose name is an acronym for the French phrase "bon chic, bon genre," or "good style, good attitude," said Wednesday that its chapter 11 case could take the form of a stand-alone restructuring, a sale or a merger.

Known for selling women's dresses for somewhere between $250 and $750, BCBG blamed its bankruptcy on a heavy debt load as well as industrywide trends like the consumer shift to online shopping and expensive leases.
