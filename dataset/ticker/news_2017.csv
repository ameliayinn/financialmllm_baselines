CHICAGO, Dec. 13, 2017

CHICAGO, Dec. 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- To celebrate United Airlines ' new daily, nonstop service between its Houston hub and Sydney, Australia starting January 18, the airline is searching for individuals across the U.S. -- excluding New York and Florida -- with the first or last name Sydney (see terms and conditions for accepted spelling variations) to enter for a chance to visit the city of their namesake with one guest through a sweepstakes launching today at SydneyHoustonUnited.com.

Five winners and their guests will experience the trip of a lifetime starting with the inaugural flight from Houston to Sydney. Meanwhile, five Australians bearing the first or last name Houston, along with their guests, will be on the return flight on January 20 from Sydney to Houston. In addition to the round-trip flight, each winner and their guest will receive hotel accommodations for five nights at The Westin Sydney, access to local sights and attractions and a $500 prepaid card to customize their trip.

Supporting United's vision to connect people and unite the world, winners will enjoy the quintessential experience of the world-class city they're named after. The ""Sydneys"" of the U.S. will enjoy a week of epic Sydney-side adventures -- beautiful beaches, big bridges and that 'true blue hospitality' Australians are known for. The ""Houstons"" from Australia, on the other hand, will swap Bondi BBQ for true Texan style, and their flip flops for cowboy boots.

This new flight will be the only nonstop service to Australia from Houston and offers customers from Houston as well as from hundreds of cities across the U.S. the opportunity to conveniently travel to Sydney. United currently serves Sydney nonstop from its West Coast hubs in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and Melbourne, Australia from Los Angeles.

For complete rules and to enter, visit SydneyHoustonUnited.com. The sweepstakes runs through December 27 and winners will be selected on or around December 28.

The problem can also allow the shift lever to be moved without pressing the brake pedal, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .

Once sworn in, Jones will reduce the GOP's Senate majority from 52-48 to 51-49, narrowing the margin of votes Republican lawmakers can afford to lose to push through a tax bill. ""Our base case is that GOP leadership will do what it takes to get a deal done in any form before Jones is officially sworn in,"" say the analysts, adding that they believe there is still a 75% probability of the tax bill becoming law. A corporate tax cut could lift S&P 500 earnings and lend additional fuel to a long stock rally, while failure to push through legislation could send stocks and bond yields lower, investors and analysts say.

0948 ET - The Oasis Petroleum deal this week to issue equity and expand into the Permian Basin highlights investor concerns about the company's primary operating area in North Dakota, according to Tudor Pickering. Companies drilling in that region may have only six years left of well locations that can provide a 30% rate of return at an oil price of $50 a barrel, according to Tudor Pickering analysis. The positions of Continental Resources and WPX Energy can be extended through 2025, but Whiting Petroleum and Oasis could be depleted by 2022 or 2023, Tudor Pickering said. (bradley.olson@wsj.com; @bradnews)

0940 ET - Oasis Petroleum , a shale company that operates primarily in North Dakota, has fallen more than 17% since Monday after announcing a deal to issue equity in order to purchase acreage in the Permian basin. The price tag of about $40,000 an acre was not unusual last year, when many companies made similar transactions that investors welcomed as smart steps into one of the hottest regions in global oil. Shareholders were less enthused by the Oasis deal, although some analysts believe the quality of the acreage will be enough to make the transaction worthwhile, according to Tudor Pickering.

0931 ET - Honeywell didn't include any tax system changes into its 2018 outlook but will update investors as details develop, it said on a conference call Wednesday. Most of its cash is overseas with repatriation costs expected to exceed $1B, which it would pay over an 8 year period. Since the tax needs to be paid anyhow, there is less friction against using the cash hoard in the US. Tax changes would require a cost adjustment to Honeywell 's annual deal modeling, but it downplayed any benefit because other companies will also get the boost. (thomas.gryta@honeywell.com; @tgryta)

0918 ET - The Democrat's win in the Alabama Senate race boosts the likelihood of a government shutdown and an extended temporary budget, says Byron Callan at Capital Alpha, though the fallout on defense contractors would be limited. Contract activity is light around the holidays, with many plants shutting down for the break. Callan says problems begin to emerge for the sector if there's no deal by late January, as spending would remain frozen and new programs are barred from starting. That could lead to a rash of calls for exemptions, as witnessed last year on programs such as the Columbia missile sub being built by General Dynamics . Fellow shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls higher in pre-open trade following a series of insider share purchases reported Tuesday. (doug.cameron@wsj.com; @dougcameron)

0914 ET - Plains All American announced an open season on its proposed pipeline project to take to Corpus Christi from the Permian Basin. The company said it had received sufficient interest to begin a binding open season with customers. The announcement comes just days after Phillips 66 and Enbridge announced open season for the Gray Oak Pipeline, another proposed line to take oil out of the Permian, the epicenter of US oil drilling. The plains project will combine existing lines with two new ones to get carry 575,000 barrels per day to Corpus where it can be used by refiners or exported from access to the Gulf of Mexico.

0906 ET - Daily freight rates for capesize vessels, the industry's biggest general cargo carriers, broke the $30,000 mark this week, the highest in four years. ""There is strong demand from China for coal and iron ore, with previously shelved infrastructure projects coming back into play,"" a Singapore broker said. New cape deliveries in 2018 will be limited, meaning freight rates may cross $40,000 in the first half of the year, well above the $25,000 average breakeven point. (costas.paris@wsj.com)

0854 ET - After rising overnight, Treasury bond yields reversed course early Wednesday, falling after data show some weakness in inflation. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note was recently at 2.381%, according to Tradeweb , compared with 2.403% Tuesday. The consumer-price index rose 0.4% in November, in line with what economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal had expected. But core prices, which exclude the more volatile categories of food and energy, rose just 0.1% in November, missing economists' estimates for a 0.2% increase. ""The lack of robustness of inflation data very much brings the continued hawkishness of the Fed into question,"" says Aaron Kohli interest-rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets .

0852 ET - The cost of seeing a physician in the US fell by a record amount over the past year. Physician prices declined 1.8% in the 12 months through November, according to the Labor Department's consumer-price index. The annual drop is the biggest since record keeping began in 1947. The trend continued in November, with prices falling 0.8% from a month earlier. (joshua.mitchell@wjs.com; @JMitchellWSJ)

0837 ET - A modest pickup in consumer prices is likely to reassure the Fed as it prepares to raise interest rates Wednesday, though underlying inflation remains sluggish. The consumer price index rose 0.4% in November from a month earlier, pushing the annual inflation rate up to 2.2%. The biggest driver was higher energy prices, which rose 3.9% over the month and accounted for about three-quarters of the overall consumer-price increase. Core prices climbed 0.1% in November from October and 1.7% over the year. That suggests the puzzle of weak inflation despite low unemployment remains unresolved.

Once sworn in, Jones will reduce the GOP's Senate majority from 52-48 to 51-49, narrowing the margin of votes Republican lawmakers can afford to lose to push through a tax bill. ""Our base case is that GOP leadership will do what it takes to get a deal done in any form before Jones is officially sworn in,"" say the analysts, adding that they believe there is still a 75% probability of the tax bill becoming law. A corporate tax cut could lift S&P 500 earnings and lend additional fuel to a long stock rally, while failure to push through legislation could send stocks and bond yields lower, investors and analysts say.

0948 ET - The Oasis Petroleum deal this week to issue equity and expand into the Permian Basin highlights investor concerns about the company's primary operating area in North Dakota, according to Tudor Pickering. Companies drilling in that region may have only six years left of well locations that can provide a 30% rate of return at an oil price of $50 a barrel, according to Tudor Pickering analysis. The positions of Continental Resources and WPX Energy can be extended through 2025, but Whiting Petroleum and Oasis could be depleted by 2022 or 2023, Tudor Pickering said.

0940 ET - Oasis Petroleum , a shale company that operates primarily in North Dakota, has fallen more than 17% since Monday after announcing a deal to issue equity in order to purchase acreage in the Permian basin. The price tag of about $40,000 an acre was not unusual last year, when many companies made similar transactions that investors welcomed as smart steps into one of the hottest regions in global oil. Shareholders were less enthused by the Oasis deal, although some analysts believe the quality of the acreage will be enough to make the transaction worthwhile, according to Tudor Pickering.

0931 ET - Honeywell didn't include any tax system changes into its 2018 outlook but will update investors as details develop, it said on a conference call Wednesday. Most of its cash is overseas with repatriation costs expected to exceed $1B, which it would pay over an 8 year period. Since the tax needs to be paid anyhow, there is less friction against using the cash hoard in the US. Tax changes would require a cost adjustment to Honeywell 's annual deal modeling, but it downplayed any benefit because other companies will also get the boost. (thomas.gryta@honeywell.com; @tgryta)

0918 ET - The Democrat's win in the Alabama Senate race boosts the likelihood of a government shutdown and an extended temporary budget, says Byron Callan at Capital Alpha, though the fallout on defense contractors would be limited. Contract activity is light around the holidays, with many plants shutting down for the break. Callan says problems begin to emerge for the sector if there's no deal by late January, as spending would remain frozen and new programs are barred from starting. That could lead to a rash of calls for exemptions, as witnessed last year on programs such as the Columbia missile sub being built by General Dynamics .

U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Accepts Bristol-Myers Squibb 's Application for Opdivo (nivolumab) Plus Yervoy (ipilimumab) in Intermediate- and Poor-Risk Patients with Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma and Grants Priority Review","The Opdivo plus Yervoy combination previously received FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation

Application based on results from phase 3 CheckMate -214 study 


PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 13, 2017-- 

Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted its supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for priority review of Opdivo (nivolumab) plus Yervoy (ipilimumab) to treat intermediate- and poor-risk patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The FDA also previously granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for this application, which is the 2nd indication for which the Opdivo plus Yervoy combination has received this designation.

""At BMS, we hope to provide treatment options to patients with advanced forms of renal cell carcinoma,"" said Murdo Gordon , executive vice president and chief commercial officer, Bristol-Myers Squibb. ""Breakthrough therapy designation and today's filing acceptance for the Opdivo plus Yervoy combination are an important step in our ongoing efforts to advance therapies to address a high unmet need in first-line treatment of kidney cancer in intermediate- and poor-risk patients.""

The application is based on data from the phase 3 CheckMate -214 study, which was stopped early based on the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee following a planned interim analysis of overall survival. The results of the study were recently presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2017 Congress.

The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is an FDA program intended to expedite the development and review of medicines with signals of potential clinical benefit in serious diseases to help ensure patients have access to new therapies as soon as possible.

The application has an action date of April 16, 2018.

About CheckMate -214

CheckMate -214 is a phase 3, randomized, open-label study evaluating the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy versus sunitinib in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Patients in the combination group received Opdivo 3 mg/kg plus Yervoy 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by Opdivo 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Patients in the comparator group received sunitinib 50 mg once daily for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks off before continuation of treatment. Patients were treated until progression or unacceptable toxic effects. The primary endpoints of the trial are overall survival, progression-free survival and objective response rate in an intermediate to poor-risk patient population (approximately 75% of patients). Safety is a secondary endpoint. The study met the co-primary endpoints of improved overall survival and objective response rate compared to sunitinib in intermediate- and poor-risk patients. While the combination demonstrated an improvement in progression-free survival relative to sunitinib, another co-primary endpoint, it did not reach statistical significance.

Adverse events (AEs) leading to discontinuation were reported in 22% of patients (547) in the combination group, compared with 12% of patients in the sunitinib group (535). The most common grade 3/4 AEs in the combination group were fatigue (4%), diarrhea (4%), rash (2%), nausea (2%), and, in less than 1% each, pruritus, hypothyroidism, vomiting and hypertension. In the sunitinib group, the most common grade 3/4 AEs were hypertension (16%), fatigue (9%), Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (9%), stomatitis (3%), mucosal inflammation (3%), vomiting (2%), nausea (1%), decreased appetite (1%), hypothyroidism (<1%) and dysgeusia (<1%). There were seven treatment-related deaths in the combination group and four in the sunitinib group.

About Renal Cell Carcinoma

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, accounting for more than 100,000 deaths worldwide each year. Clear-cell RCC is the most prevalent type of RCC and constitutes 80% to 90% of all patients. RCC is approximately twice as common in men as in women, with the highest rates of the disease in North America and Europe. Globally, the five-year survival rate for those diagnosed with metastatic, or advanced, kidney cancer is 12.1%.

Bristol-Myers Squibb & Immuno-Oncology: Advancing Oncology Research

At Bristol-Myers Squibb , patients are at the center of everything we do. Our vision for the future of cancer care is focused on researching and developing transformational Immuno-Oncology (I-O) medicines for hard-to-treat cancers that could potentially improve outcomes for these patients.

We are leading the scientific understanding of I-O through our extensive portfolio of investigational compounds and approved agents. Our differentiated clinical development program is studying broad patient populations across more than 50 types of cancers with 14 clinical-stage molecules designed to target different immune system pathways. Our deep expertise and innovative clinical trial designs position us to advance I-O/I-O, I-O/chemotherapy, I-O/targeted therapies and I-O radiation therapies across multiple tumors and potentially deliver the next wave of therapies with a sense of urgency. We also continue to pioneer research that will help facilitate a deeper understanding of the role of immune biomarkers and how patients' tumor biology can be used as a guide for treatment decisions throughout their journey.

We understand making the promise of I-O a reality for the many patients who may benefit from these therapies requires not only innovation on our part but also close collaboration with leading experts in the field.

Opdivo is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body's own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body's own immune system to fight cancer, Opdivo has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.

Opdivo's leading global development program is based on Bristol-Myers Squibb 's scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the Opdivo clinical development program has enrolled more than 25,000 patients. The Opdivo trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from Opdivo across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.

In July 2014, Opdivo was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. Opdivo is currently approved in more than 60 countries, including the United States, the European Union and Japan. In October 2015, the company's Opdivo and Yervoy combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology combination to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union .

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WARNING: IMMUNE-MEDIATED ADVERSE REACTIONS

YERVOY can result in severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system; however, the most common severe immune-mediated adverse reactions are enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis), neuropathy, and endocrinopathy. The majority of these immune-mediated reactions initially manifested during treatment; however, a minority occurred weeks to months after discontinuation of YERVOY.

Assess patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, neuropathy, and endocrinopathy and evaluate clinical chemistries including liver function tests (LFTs), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function tests at baseline and before each dose.

Permanently discontinue YERVOY and initiate systemic high-dose corticosteroid therapy for severe immune-mediated reactions.

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. Fatal cases have been reported. Monitor patients for signs with radiographic imaging and for symptoms of pneumonitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or more severe pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 and withhold until resolution for Grade 2. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, fatal cases of immune-mediated pneumonitis have occurred. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients. In patients receiving OPDIVO with YERVOY, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 6% (25/407) of patients.

In Checkmate 205 and 039, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 6.0% (16/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.9% (13/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO: Grade 3 (n=1) and Grade 2 (n=12).

Immune-Mediated Encephalitis

OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated encephalitis. Evaluation of patients with neurologic symptoms may include, but not be limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture. Withhold OPDIVO in patients with new-onset moderate to severe neurologic signs or symptoms and evaluate to rule out other causes. If other etiologies are ruled out, administer corticosteroids and permanently discontinue OPDIVO for immune-mediated encephalitis. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, encephalitis occurred in 0.2% (3/1994) of patients. Fatal limbic encephalitis occurred in one patient after 7.2 months of exposure despite discontinuation of OPDIVO and administration of corticosteroids. Encephalitis occurred in one patient receiving OPDIVO with YERVOY (0.2%) after 1.7 months of exposure.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, permanently discontinue or withhold OPDIVO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and, if appropriate, initiate hormone-replacement therapy. Across clinical trials of OPDIVO monotherapy or in combination with YERVOY, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in <1.0% of patients receiving OPDIVO: myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, uveitis, iritis, pancreatitis, facial and abducens nerve paresis, demyelination, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune neuropathy, Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, hypopituitarism, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, gastritis, duodenitis, sarcoidosis, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), motor dysfunction, vasculitis, and myasthenic syndrome.

Infusion Reactions

OPDIVO can cause severe infusion reactions, which have been reported in <1.0% of patients in clinical trials. Discontinue OPDIVO in patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with Grade 1 or 2. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In patients receiving OPDIVO with YERVOY, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients.

Complications of Allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO

Complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who received allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO. Outcomes were evaluated in 17 patients from Checkmate 205 and 039, who underwent allogeneic HSCT after discontinuing OPDIVO (15 with reduced-intensity conditioning, 2 with myeloablative conditioning). Thirty-five percent (6/17) of patients died from complications of allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO. Five deaths occurred in the setting of severe or refractory GVHD. Grade 3 or higher acute GVHD was reported in 29% (5/17) of patients. Hyperacute GVHD was reported in 20% (n=2) of patients. A steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, without an identified infectious cause, was reported in 35% (n=6) of patients. Two cases of encephalitis were reported: Grade 3 (n=1) lymphocytic encephalitis without an identified infectious cause, and Grade 3 (n=1) suspected viral encephalitis. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) occurred in one patient, who received reduced-intensity conditioned allogeneic HSCT and died of GVHD and multi-organ failure. Other cases of hepatic VOD after reduced-intensity conditioned allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody before transplantation. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD have also been reported. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT.

Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on their mechanisms of action, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with an OPDIVO- or YERVOY- containing regimen and for at least 5 months after the last dose of OPDIVO.

Lactation

It is not known whether OPDIVO or YERVOY is present in human milk. Because many drugs, including antibodies, are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from an OPDIVO-containing regimen, advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment. Advise women to discontinue nursing during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months following the final dose.

2017-12-13,SPG,Mall Owners Look to Courts,"When all else fails, sue.

Decades of overbuilding have saddled property markets with too many malls as online shopping and changing consumer preferences are reshaping the retail sector. Now, landlords, tenants and investors are looking to the courts for relief.","Friction between landlords and tenants usually centers on clauses that allow retailers to receive rent concessions if certain anchor tenants leave the mall or if occupancy levels fall below a certain threshold.

A recent court ruling granting a preliminary injunction to prevent Starbucks Corp. from closing Teavana stores in 77 retail locations owned by mall landlord Simon Property Group Inc. is causing more tenants to scrutinize lease contracts as concerns mount that they could end up in the same boat.

Some tenants, alarmed by the injunction, are demanding clauses in lease contracts that allow them to terminate early, said Corey Bialow, chief executive at Bialow Real Estate LLC, a firm that represents retail tenants.

Court filings show that the landlord's fear is that the departure of Teavana could result in a retail version of a bank run.

""Each premature closure is viewed by tenants as an indication of a larger possible problem with the mall retail environment and emboldens other tenants to approach Simon and ask to close some or all of their stores,"" according to court documents quoting testimony by Bruce Tobin, Simon's senior executive vice president of leasing malls.

Simon didn't respond to requests for additional comment. Starbucks didn't respond to requests for comment, but has said it was disappointed by the ruling.

The uncertainty over occupancy and leasing success in malls, strip centers and other retail properties is also driving disputes between lenders and landlords. In particular, some owners of properties that are more highly leveraged and funded with riskier debt face a greater threat of their property getting repossessed by lenders if the owners are unable to meet their debt obligations.

Activist investors also have been circling mall real-estate investment trusts, whose share prices have been sliding for the past year.

Taubman Centers Inc. has spent roughly $12 million in legal and advisory services fees in the first nine months this year on activities related to a shareholder activist campaign launched by Jonathan Litt. Meanwhile, Paul Singer's Elliott Management Corp., another firm known for agitating for change, recently took a stake in the luxury-mall operator. Taubman and Elliott declined to comment.

Target to Acquire Same-Day Delivery Platform Shipt, Inc. to Bolster Fulfillment Capabilities","Acquisition will enable Target to offer same-day delivery services at approximately half its stores by early 2018

PR Newswire

MINNEAPOLIS, Dec. 13, 2017

MINNEAPOLIS, Dec. 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Target Corp . (NYSE: TGT) today announced it has agreed to acquire Shipt, Inc., a leading online same-day delivery platform, for $550 million in cash. Target will leverage its network of stores and Shipt's proprietary technology platform and community of shoppers to quickly and efficiently bring same-day delivery to guests across the country. The acquisition significantly accelerates Target 's digital fulfillment efforts, bringing same-day delivery services to guests at approximately half of Target stores by early 2018. The service will be offered from the majority of Target stores, and in all major markets, before the 2018 holiday season.

At launch, Target will offer same-day delivery of groceries, essentials, home, electronics and other products, while expanding the products offered over time. By the end of 2019, same-day delivery will include all major product categories at Target .

""We laid out an ambitious strategic agenda in early 2017, which included a focus on giving our guests a number of convenient ways to shop with Target , whether it's ordering online and picking up in one of our stores, driving up to pick up an order, or taking advantage of services like our new Restock program. With Shipt's network of local shoppers and their current market penetration, we will move from days to hours, dramatically accelerating our ability to bring affordable same-day delivery to guests across the country,"" said John Mulligan , executive vice president and chief operating officer for Target. ""By the 2018 holiday season, we will be servicing every major market across the country with same-day delivery, and Shipt's service-oriented approach aligns well with Target 's commitment to delivering an exceptional shopping experience for our guests.""

Founded in 2014 and located in Birmingham, Alabama, Shipt is a rapidly growing membership-based grocery marketplace and same-day delivery platform. The service leverages an extensive network of over 20,000 personal shoppers to fulfill orders from various retailers and deliver within hours in more than 72 markets. Shipt values a personalized, customer-first delivery experience that simplifies life and saves time for members. Through Shipt's app, members are connected to local, reliable shoppers who help facilitate a quality delivery experience that is personalized, efficient and convenient.

""We are very excited to partner with Target , one of the most loved retailers in the country with a reputation for supporting local communities. Partnering with Target and the national scale they provide allows Shipt to further accelerate our growth, bringing our service to more people, in more markets across the country,"" said Bill Smith, Shipt's founder and CEO. ""We'll continue growing our marketplace and membership base, working with a variety of retailers to drive scale and efficiencies. We look forward to introducing Target guests to the convenience of our same-day delivery services, with the level of personal attention only Shipt can provide.""

Shipt will be a wholly owned Target subsidiary, and will continue to run its business independently. It also plans to expand partnerships with other retailers seeking same-day, last-mile capabilities. All current Shipt employees will continue to be employed by Shipt and will work from their current offices in Birmingham and San Francisco. Chief Executive Officer Bill Smith will remain in his current role, and will report to Target Chief Operating Officer, John Mulligan . In addition to same-day delivery capabilities, Target will also leverage Shipt's expertise as the company enhances and strengthens its supply chain, including integration with the recently acquired transportation technology company, Grand Junction.

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close prior to the end of calendar year 2017. This all-cash acquisition will be immaterial to Target 's near-term financial results. It is expected to be modestly accretive to the company's earnings per share in 2018, while accelerating digital and total sales growth over the medium term.

Miscellaneous

Statements in this release regarding the future availability of same-day delivery services at Target stores through the Shipt network, the expected impact of the transaction on Target 's fiscal 2017 financial results and 2018 earnings per share, and the expected impact on digital and total sales growth are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially.

2017-12-14,PFE,Press Release: Phase 3 TRUMENBA(R) (Meningococcal Group B Vaccine) Data Published in New England Journal of Medicine Demonstrate the Vaccine's Immunogenicity,"Phase 3 TRUMENBA(R) (Meningococcal Group B Vaccine) Data Published in New England Journal of Medicine Demonstrate the Vaccine's Immunogenicity 


NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 13, 2017-- ","Pfizer Inc . (NYSE: PFE) today announced that detailed results from two pivotal Phase 3 studies of TRUMENBA(R) (Meningococcal Group B Vaccine) were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Data from both studies demonstrated that TRUMENBA, as a three-dose series, elicits a protective immune response against diverse meningococcal group B (MenB) strains representative of prevalent strains causing invasive disease in the United States and Europe. These studies met all five co-primary immunogenicity endpoints against a panel of diverse test strains.

""Pfizer is proud of the completion and publication of these studies, which underscore the ability of TRUMENBA to help protect against the diverse MenB strains that can cause this devastating disease,"" said Kathrin Jansen, Ph.D., senior vice president and head of Vaccine Research and Development for Pfizer Inc .

Early symptoms of meningococcal disease can be misinterpreted as the flu, often making it difficult to diagnose and delaying treatment; however, it is a serious disease that can lead to death within 24 hours.(1) The most common clinical presentations of meningococcal disease are meningitis and septicemia.(2) Up to one quarter of adolescents may be asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis.(3)

""MenB disease is uncommon, yet serious, is unpredictable and can strike at any age, including healthy teenagers and young adults in the prime of their lives, with potentially long-lasting and devastating consequences, including mortality,"" said Federico Martinon-Torres, MD, Ph.D., head of Pediatrics and director of Translational Pediatrics and Infectious Diseases at Hospital ClÃ­nico Universitario de Santiago de Compostela, Spain. ""As a physician, I am pleased to see these data which highlight that this vaccine can help protect teenagers and young adults against MenB.""

Despite prompt and appropriate antibiotic treatment, 10 to 15% of people with meningococcal disease will die.(1) Of those adolescents who survive, three in five experience significant physical and mental disabilities, such as brain damage, hearing loss, learning disabilities, or limb amputations.(1,2,4)

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends routine use of MenB vaccines among persons aged 10 years and older who are at increased risk. The CDC recommendations also state that healthy adolescents and young adults aged 16 to 23 years may be vaccinated. Recently updated CDC recommendations advise using the three-dose TRUMENBA schedule (0, 1--2, and 6 months) in high-risk individuals, and the two-dose schedule (0 and 6 months) for healthy adolescents and young adults.

These published data are now available for vaccine technical committees and other public health authorities to review as they evaluate recommendations for the use of TRUMENBA in adolescents and young adults.

About the Phase 3 Studies

The two Phase 3 randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trials, which were previously presented at the 34th Annual Meeting of the European Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases (ESPID 2016), included nearly 7,000 healthy adolescents and young adults, 10 to 18 years of age and 18 to 25 years of age, respectively, in the U.S., Europe, and Canada. In the studies, TRUMENBA, administered on a three-dose schedule (0, 2, and 6 months), demonstrated immunogenicity against four primary MenB strains representative of strains causing invasive disease.

Immune responses in both studies were assessed by serum bactericidal assays using human complement (hSBA). The primary immunogenicity objectives assessed the immune responses to four primary MenB test strains representative of prevalent MenB strains one month after dose three. The secondary endpoint measured responses to 10 additional diverse, disease--causing MenB test strains.

The proportion of adolescents (n=2571) achieving >=4-fold increases in hSBA titers against each primary strain after dose three was 78.8% to 90.2%; responses in young adults (n=2169) were 78.9% to 89.7%. Composite responses, the proportion of subjects that achieved a prespecified hSBA titer for all four primary strains, were 82.7% in adolescents and 84.5% in young adults after dose three. The responses to the 10 additional strains were comparable to those seen against the four primary strains. The most common solicited adverse reactions in adolescents and young adults were pain at injection site, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain.

About Meningococcal Disease and Immunization

The majority of invasive meningococcal disease cases worldwide can be attributed to six N meningitidis serogroups (A, B, C, W, X, and Y). Together, serogroups A, B, C, W, and Y account for 90% of all invasive meningococcal disease (IMD)(5) , with MenB accounting for the majority of disease in adolescents and young adults in the U.S. and Europe.(6)

TRUMENBA was granted Accelerated Approval in the U.S. in October 2014 for active immunization to prevent invasive disease caused by N meningitidis serogroup B (MenB) in individuals 10 through 25 years of age. These Phase 3 data supported the transition to Traditional Approval in the U.S. for the three-dose schedule and were pivotal for approvals in Europe, Australia, and Canada earlier this year. TRUMENBA can be administered as a two- or three-dose schedule depending on an individual's risk of exposure and susceptibility to MenB.

U.S. Indication for TRUMENBA(R) (Meningococcal Group B Vaccine)

TRUMENBA(R) (Meningococcal Group B Vaccine) is a vaccine indicated for individuals 10 through 25 years of age for active immunization to prevent invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis group B.

The effectiveness of the two-dose schedule of TRUMENBA against diverse N meningitidis serogroup B strains has not been confirmed.

U.S. Important Safety Information

TRUMENBA(R) (Meningococcal Group B Vaccine) should not be given to anyone with a history of a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of TRUMENBA.

Individuals with weakened immune systems may have a reduced immune response.

As with any vaccine, vaccination with TRUMENBA may not protect all vaccine recipients against N meningitidis group B infections.

The most common adverse reactions in adolescents and young adults were pain at injection site, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain. Nausea was reported in adolescents in early phase studies.

Data are not available on the safety and effectiveness of using TRUMENBA and other meningococcal group B vaccines interchangeably to complete the vaccination series.

Tell your health care provider if you are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant.

Ask your health care provider about the risks and benefits of TRUMENBA. Only a health care provider can decide if TRUMENBA is right for you or your child.

You are encouraged to report negative side effects of vaccines to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Visit www.vaers.hhs.gov or call 1-800-822-7967.

About TRUMENBA(R) (Meningococcal Group B Vaccine)

TRUMENBA(R) (Meningococcal Group B Vaccine) is a sterile suspension composed of two recombinant lipidated factor H binding protein (fHBP) variants from N meningitidis serogroup B, one from fHBP subfamily A and one from subfamily B (A05 and B01, respectively). fHBP is one of many proteins found on the surface of meningococci and contributes to the ability of the bacterium to avoid host defenses. fHBPs can be categorized into two immunologically distinct subfamilies, A and B. The susceptibility of serogroup B meningococci to complement--mediated, antibody--dependent killing following vaccination with TRUMENBA is dependent on both the antigenic similarity of the bacterial and vaccine fHBPs, as well as the amount of fHBP expressed on the surface of the invading meningococci.(7)

As with any vaccine, TRUMENBA may not prevent disease in all vaccinated individuals. The frequency of meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B varies geographically, and could influence the ability to evaluate effectiveness of the vaccine in any given country. Based on the low incidence of meningococcal disease, placebo--controlled clinical trials for TRUMENBA were considered unfeasible due to the size of the study that would be required and were not performed. Licensure of TRUMENBA was based on demonstration of immune responses measured using a serum bactericidal assay with human complement (hSBA).

2017-12-18,HUM,Humana and PE Firms in Talks to Buy Kindred Healthcare,"Humana Inc. is in advanced talks to join with two private-equity firms in a deal to acquire home-care provider Kindred Healthcare Inc., a move that would add to a cascade of transactions aiming to bring together insurance operations with other health-care businesses.

As part of the complex deal, Kindred, a sprawling company with $7.2 billion in revenue last year, is to be divided, according to people familiar with the matter. Welsh Carson Anderson & Stowe and TPG would take over Kindredâs facility-focused business, which includes long-term acute-care hospitals and rehabilitation centers, while the private-equity firms together with Humana would get its home- and hospice-care operation.","The deal would value Kindred at $9 a share, the people said, a modest premium to where the shares currently trade after rallying sharply in recent weeks. Kindred stock closed Friday at $8.60, giving the debt-laden company a market value of about $750 million. Factoring in debt, Kindred has a so-called enterprise value of about $4 billion.

Though a deal could be announced soon, itâs still possible the talks could fall apart.

Kindred is the biggest home-health and hospice operator in the U.S. Its facilities business, meanwhile, includes around 77 long-term care hospitals and 19 rehabilitation hospitals.

Its shares have lagged amid skepticism about the future of some of the companyâs core businesses, which are heavily dependent on reimbursement from the federal Medicare program. Kindredâs 2015 acquisition of Gentiva Health Services Inc. also left the company with a heavy debt load. To help improve its finances, Kindred has been selling off its nursing homes.

Humana, like Kindred based in Louisville, Ky., already has some home-health operations, and has said it wants to get deeper into that business as a way to better manage the health of its Medicare enrollees. The insurer has said it believes closer ties to home-health services and physicians will help it improve care and hold down costs. âHome is often a superior clinical environment to deliver care and reduce high-cost hospital admissions,â Chief Executive Bruce Broussard said during Humanaâs third-quarter earnings call on Nov. 8.

Rivals are making similar moves. UnitedHealth Group Inc. has been on a yearslong campaign to purchase doctor groups, urgent-care clinics and surgery centers. The company announced earlier this month it would buy the physician-group unit of DaVita Inc. for $4.9 billion.

Meanwhile, Aetna Inc. recently agreed to be acquired by drugstore giantCVS Health Corp. for nearly $70 billion. CVS and Aetna have said they want to use the pharmacies as a source of care and coordination for members, including in the home.

The insurersâ moves into the health-care provider businesses, often with the goal of reducing patientsâ use of hospitals, are being countered by hospital companies. Major nonprofit hospital operators Dignity Health and Catholic Health Initiatives have announced they are combining. Ascension and Providence St. Joseph Health, also nonprofits, are in talks about a potential merger that would create the biggest U.S. hospital owner.

For insurers, the tack is partly a reaction to the death of a previous round of proposed deals. Aetnaâs $34 billion planned acquisition of Humana ran aground this year in the face of an antitrust challenge by the Justice Department. Anthem Inc.âs planned takeover of rival Cigna Corp. was also blocked. Cross-industry combinations like the new round of proposed deals could avoid such pushback.

In the wake of the collapse of its Aetna deal, analysts have suggested Humana itself might be acquired, a possibly that would seem more remote as a result of a tie-up with Kindredâat least for now.

Humana has a long, on-and-off history in the health-care provider business. In 2015, it sold off Concentra, an urgent-care and occupational-health clinic operator. It was once a major owner of hospitals, but spun them off in 1993 after rival health plans steered patients to competitors.

AMARILLO, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 18, 2017-- ","Bell Helicopter, a Textron Inc . (NYSE: TXT) company, today announced that its V-280 Valor has achieved first flight. The V-280 Valor is a next-generation tiltrotor that is designed to provide unmatched agility, speed, range and payload capabilities at an affordable cost.

""This is an exciting time for Bell Helicopter, and I could not be more proud of the progress we have made with first flight of the Bell V-280,"" says Mitch Snyder , President & CEO for Bell Helicopter. ""First flight demonstrates our commitment to supporting Department of Defense leadership's modernization priorities and acquisition reform initiatives. The Valor is designed to revolutionize vertical lift for the U.S. Army and represents a transformational aircraft for all the challenging missions our armed forces are asked to undertake.

""We are thrilled to share in this success of the V-280 first flight with Team Valor,"" added Snyder. ""The V-280 intends to completely transform what is possible for the military when it comes to battle planning and forward operations.""

The Bell V-280 Valor program is part of the Joint Multi Role Technology Demonstrator (JMR-TD) initiative.

The Bell V-280 Valor is postured to provide the U.S. Army with the highest levels of maturity and technical readiness. The aircraft is designed to provide the best value in procurement, operations and support, and force structure, while delivering desired leap-ahead performance capabilities with increased maintainability, reliability and affordability to the DoD. With twice the speed and range of conventional helicopters, the Valor is designed to offer maneuver commanders unmatched operational agility to self-deploy and perform a multitude of vertical lift missions currently unachievable in one aircraft. The Bell V-280 is a combat force multiplier with superior performance, payload, survivability, and reliability to give the warfighter the decisive advantage.

2017-12-19,DOV,"*S&PGR Downgrds Dover Corp. To 'BBB+' From 'A-', Outlook Stable","18 Dec 2017 13:00 ET 
Press Release: S&PGR Downgrds Dover Corp. To 'BBB+' From 'A-', Outlook Stable","
 
 
The following is a press release from Standard & Poor's : 
 
     -- Dover Corp . is spinning off the upstream energy business within its 
Dover Energy segment (wellsite) to create a standalone public company. 
     -- Dover will likely receive a $700 million-$800 million dividend from 
the transaction, which it will use to fund the bulk of its planned $1 billion 
of share repurchases by the end of 2018. 
     -- Therefore, we are downgrading Dover Corp . to 'BBB+' from 'A-'. 
     -- The stable outlook reflects our belief that Dover's debt leverage and 
other credit measures will remain appropriate for the current rating given the 
healthy global economy, management's continued cost improvements, the 
meaningful proceeds the company will receive from the spin-off of its upstream 
energy business, and its financial discipline. 
 
NEW YORK (S&P Global Ratings) Dec. 18, 2017--S&P Global Ratings today lowered 
its long-term corporate credit rating on Downers Grove, Ill.-based Dover Corp . 
to 'BBB+' from 'A-'. The outlook is stable. 
 
At the same time, we lowered our issue-level rating on the company's senior 
unsecured debt to 'BBB+' from 'A-' in accordance with our corporate notching 
methodology. 
 
The downgrade reflects our view that the tax-free spin-off of Dover's wellsite 
business is likely to occur, and that this, combined with the November 2017 
divestiture of its Warn Industries  consumer and industrial winch business, 
will meaningfully reduce the company's scale, the scope of its operations, and 
its business diversity. Wellsite's capabilities include artificial lift, 
energy automation, and drilling technologies and the business generates 
roughly $1 billion of annual sales with EBITDA margins of approximately 25% 
(excluding restructuring costs and public company expenses). While Dover's 
margins in its remaining energy segment are slightly higher than 25%, the 
wellsite spin-off will reduce the company's end-market diversity. Dover's 
energy segment enjoyed strong organic revenue growth of over 25% in 2017 as 
the active rig count increased, the overall oil and gas environment 
strengthened, and management's restructuring initiatives helped increase the 
segment margins to 14%. Before these restructuring initiatives, the company's 
margins in this segment were a meager 3%. 
 
The stable outlook on Dover reflects our belief that the company's credit 
measures will remain appropriate for the current rating following the spin-off 
of its wellsite business. We anticipate that the company will continue to 
enjoy solid organic growth over the next two years given the healthy 
macroeconomic environment. We expect management to focus on its operational 
execution and price discipline to offset material cost inflation while its 
repays its commercial paper balance and keeps its debt balance relatively 
constant. The company's FFO-to-debt ratio will approach 30% in 2017 before 
eventually eclipsing that mark and remaining in the 30%-35% range during the 
next two years. While the spin-off will have a slightly dilutive effect on 
Dover's margins, we expect that the company's increased focus on operational 
execution will help offset this dilution. 
 
We could lower our ratings on Dover if the company's credit measures stagnate 
or deteriorate meaningfully during the next two years. This could occur 
because of weakening end markets, greater-than-expected cost inflation, or a 
more aggressive financial policy. 
 
In addition, we could downgrade Dover if its receives a smaller-than-expected 
dividend from the spin-off, if it meaningfully increases its share 
repurchases, or if it engages in high cost debt-funded mergers or acquisitions 
without appropriately curtailing its share repurchases or other capital uses, 
thus weakening its credit measures. Specifically, we could downgrade the 
company if its free operating cash flow-to-debt ratio declines to 15% on a 
sustained basis. 
 
While unlikely in the next two years, we could raise our ratings on Dover if 
the company markedly improves its margins and increases its FFO-to-debt ratio 
above 40% on a consistent basis. An upgrade would also be contingent on 
management's adoption of a considerably more conservative financial policy 
while it continues to enhance the scale and scope of Dover's operations.

Colgate Announces Acquisition of PCA Skin and EltaMD Skin Care Brands ","
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 18, 2017-- 

Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), as part of its strategy to focus on its higher-margin oral care, personal care and pet nutrition businesses, today announced that it has agreed to purchase PCA Skin and EltaMD, two of the fastest-growing brands in professional skin care, in two separate transactions. These acquisitions will enable Colgate to enter the highly attractive professional skin care category while complementing its existing global personal care businesses.

EltaMD is a leading physician-dispensed sun care brand with a unique positioning around broad-spectrum, everyday use, physician-dispensed sunscreen.

They are distributed in the U.S., China and certain other international markets. Colgate plans to continue to operate the brands independently after closing.

Ian Cook, Colgate's Chairman, President and CEO commented, ""PCA Skin and EltaMD form an exciting combination for Colgate's entry into the professional skin care category. We are delighted that these high-growth, high-margin brands will strengthen our global personal care business. Their complementary product portfolios and sales forces, strong professional support and similar distribution channels will advance Colgate's presence in the premium global skin care category. Furthermore, these businesses will benefit from Colgate's decades long legacy of working with professional experts to deliver recommendations that benefit their patients.""

The terms of the deals have not been disclosed. Both transactions are currently expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. The acquisitions are subject to customary closing conditions, including U.S. antitrust clearance.

These transactions are expected to have no impact on earnings in 2018.

2017-12-18,CPB,*S&PGR Downgrades Campbell Soup Co. To 'BBB'; Outlook Negative,"18 Dec 2017 09:36 ET 
Press Release: S&PGR Downgrades Campbell Soup Co. To 'BBB'; Outlook Negative","
 
 
The following is a press release from Standard & Poor's : 
 
     -- U.S.-based Campbell Soup Co . is purchasing Snyder's-Lance Inc . for 
about $6.1 billion. We believe that the transaction will close in the calendar 
second quarter of 2018. 
     -- We believe the proposed acquisition will substantially increase 
Campbell's debt obligations and meaningfully weaken its credit protection 
measures. 
     -- As a result, we are lowering all of our long-term ratings on Campbell, 
including our corporate credit rating, to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'. 
     -- We are also affirming our 'A-2' short-term and commercial paper 
ratings. 
     -- The negative outlook reflects the pro forma credit metric 
deterioration following the acquisition, the inherent integration risks of 
such a large acquisition, and the risk that Campbell's Fresh segment will 
continue to underperform, as well as that Snyder's-Lance  relatively weak 
margins may not rebound, thus causing Campbell to struggle to reduce leverage 
below 4.0x over the next 24 months. 
 
NEW YORK (S&P Global Ratings) Dec. 18, 2017--S&P Global Ratings said today 
that it had lowered its corporate credit rating on Camden, New Jersey-based 
Campbell Soup Co . to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'. The outlook is negative. At the same 
time, we affirmed the 'A-2' short-term rating. 
 
We also lowered the existing issue-level ratings to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'. 
 
The ratings are based on preliminary information and can change if the terms 
of transaction change. We estimate that Campbell's pro forma fund debt for the 
acquisition would be roughly $10.3 billion at the transaction's close, based 
on current financing expectations. 
 
The downgrade reflects our belief that Campbell's pro forma credit protection 
measures will meaningfully deteriorate following this acquisition and will 
remain weaker than our prior expectations for several years after the close of 
the transaction. In addition, S&P Global Ratings believes the company's 
willingness to fund a large acquisition almost entirely with debt is a 
departure from its historically conservative financial policy that supports 
the current ratings. We see the possibility that Campbell will not be able to 
deleverage below 4.0x over the next 24 months because it may have difficulty 
strengthening Snyder's-Lance 's EBITDA margins, which are below peer averages. 
This comes especially at a time when it needs to reverse negative trends in 
its Campbell Fresh division, it needs to improve the margins of its recently 
acquired Pacific Food business, and its high-margin soup business is declining. 
 
Campbell will fund the acquisition almost entirely with debt. We estimate that 
the company's adjusted leverage will have increased to about 4.9x and that 
funds from operations (FFO) to debt will have dropped to below 15%, from 2.2x 
and 36%, respectively, for the 12 months ended Oct. 31, 2017. We had expected 
Campbell to maintain leverage at below 3.0x to maintain the current ratings 
and outlook. Our ratings now factor in our belief that Campbell will not 
improve credit metrics near those levels until the fiscal year 2022 (ending 
July 31) or thereafter. 
 
We expect that Campbell will prioritize debt reduction over shareholder 
returns during the next couple of years, including suspending its 
share-repurchase program. Under our base-case scenario, we estimate that 
Campbell will modestly deleverage during the next two years, with adjusted 
leverage declining to 4.2x at the end of fiscal 2019 and 3.8x in fiscal 2020 
and FFO to debt will strengthen to 18% and 20%, respectively. 
 
The negative outlook reflects the pro forma credit metric deterioration that 
will result from the proposed transaction and the inherent integration risks 
of a large acquisition at a time when Campbell's soup business, the Campbell 
Fresh segment, and Snyder's-Lance  are all underperforming. This results in the 
potential for Campbell to struggle to deleverage below 4x over the next 24 
months. If we lower the corporate credit rating, we will lower the rating on 
the commercial paper to 'A-3'. 
 
We could lower the ratings over the next 12-24 months if there are unexpected 
operating missteps in the integration or it is affected by the weak retail 
environment, leading to weaker profitability and cash flows, and adjusted debt 
to EBITDA remains above 4x. In addition, we could also lower the ratings if 
the company demonstrates a more aggressive financial policy by prioritizing 
cash to shareholder-friendly activities or another medium or large 
debt-financed acquisition that results in leverage remaining above 4x. 
 
We could revise the outlook to stable if the company successfully integrates 
Snyder's-Lance  and realizes the cost synergies as planned, and it strengthens 
credit metrics, including improving adjusted debt to EBITDA toward to the 
low-4x range with a clear path to deleveraging below 4x through a combination 
of EBITDA growth and debt reduction.

2017-12-30,GS,"EDF Energy Buys Commercial Contracts, Assets in Northeast -- Market Talk","1149 ET - EDF Energy Services continues to revamp and expand in the North American power market. Following the recent shake-up of its Houston trading floor, the subsidiary of conglomerate Electricite de France says it'll buy TransCanada Power Marketing's commercial contracts and assets in the northeast. TransCanada , the Canadian company behind the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline and a vast network of gas delivery lines, has been trying to wind down its power marketing business in 2017. EDF is the world's biggest electricity generator and has been actively pursuing deals to boost its US footprint. The deal significantly increases EDF's presence in North American power markets, particularly on the eastern seaboard where pipelines shortages and extreme weather can create big electricity and gas price spikes in volatile trading. The deal is expected to close during the first quarter. (lynn.cook@wsj.com; @LynnJCook)","1137 ET - While most US companies are rejoicing over lower tax rates, Eaton is among those facing a bigger tax bill from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The company relocated its corporate headquarters to Ireland a few years ago from Cleveland to reduce its taxes. But the new tax legislation is designed to discourage those moves. The maker of electrical gear and truck transmissions, anticipates logging a $90M-$110M one-time tax charge in 4Q that will likely shave EPS by about 20 cents. Roughly half of the expense is related to the recalibration of US deferred tax balances and the other half is for taxation of unremitted earnings of non-US operations owned by Eaton's US subsidiaries. Eaton expects its effective tax rate in 2018 to increase to 14%-16% from an earlier forecast of 11%-13%. (Robert.tita@wsj.com)

0808 ET - US stock futures are higher as Wall Street heads into its last trading day of 2017, a year that exceeded the expectations of many investors with the S&P up 20%, the Dow up 25% and the Nasdaq up 29%. In Europe the Stoxx Europe 600 is bobbing between small gains and losses in thin trading ahead of the New Year holiday. Overall, the MSCI AC World ex-USA Index, which tracks stocks across developed and emerging markets outside the US, is poised to end 2017 with gains of roughly 24% helped by an upswing in growth around the world. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury is at 2.428% ahead of an early 2pm ET close for bond trading here in the US ahead of the long holiday weekend. S&P futures up 9.75 points. (patrick.sheridan@wsj.com )

0731 ET - Goldman Sachs will take $5B in earnings charges attributable to the US tax overhaul. Goldman says two-thirds of the charge stems from a repatriation tax it will pay on cash it is bringing back from overseas operations. (That tax is actually lower under the new system, but the reduction encourages companies to repatriate cash they might otherwise have left abroad.) Goldman is also taking an unspecified write-down of its deferred tax assets, which are past losses that can be used to defray future tax bills. Many banks that had near-death experiences during the crisis--Bank of America has more than $19B of them in its pocket--will have to write down these credits, which are now worth less after the tax overhaul reduced the headline corporate tax from 35% to 21%. (liz.hoffman@wsj.com; @lizrhoffman)

0323 ET - The dollar has eased further so far in Friday's global session, though not like the selloff seen during Asia's afternoon yesterday. It's widely down 0.1-0.2%, with the euro at $1.1960 and the pound at $1.3475. The WSJ Dollar Index was at 3-month lows late Thursday in New York and it's dropped more than 7% this year, on pace for its biggest decline since 2007. ""2017 has been marked by persistent dollar weakness, and with year-end flows easing it will close out the year in the same way,"" notes BK Asset Management. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)

2017-12-29,ACN,Business News: Outsourcing Grabs More of Workforce,"The list of the world's largest employers was once dominated by household names like Ford Motor Co., J.C. Penney Co., and General Electric Co., companies that made and sold things.

A new analysis conducted for The Wall Street Journal shows those names are nowhere to be found on that list today. In their place are large outsourcing companies like Compass Group PLC, Accenture PLC and other businesses that essentially lease workers to clients.","Of the top 20 global employers in 2017, five are outsourcing and ""workforce solutions"" companies, according to an analysis by S&P Global Market Intelligence. In 2000, only one employer in the top 20 -- International Business Machines Corp., which offers outsourced information-technolgy services among its many businesses -- fell into that bucket.

Outsourcing companies are vacuuming up the world's workers as traditional employers are handing over more of their tasks to nonemployees, a shift that has transformed the way corporations do business and profoundly affected workers' prospects and pay.

The past two decades have been boom times for the outsourcing sector, with the annual value of contracts growing to $37 billion in 2016 from $12.5 billion in 2000, according to research and advisory firm Information Services Group Inc. The market is expected show growth again in 2017 and 2018, thanks partly to a double-digit increase in big technology projects as more companies transfer massive volumes of data to the cloud.

For employers, dispatching work to outside companies saves money and lets them access skills they need without adding to their head count. Workers in jobs that have gone to outsourcers, though, can feel moved around like chess pieces, either displaced entirely or re-badged as employees of a service provider, sometimes with fewer benefits and lower pay. A growing body of economic research suggests that outsourcing is a significant factor fueling the rise of income inequality in the past decade.

""If all the engineers are in one firm and the cleaners are in another, you get less diversity within firms and more inequality across firms,"" says Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University.

Dublin-based Accenture, best known as an IT and consulting firm, has become the de facto back office for hundreds of client companies. The firm employs 435,000 people globally -- up from some 200,000 in 2010 -- and serves 95 of the Fortune Global 100 with consulting or outsourcing services or both. Outsourcing made up 46% of the company's 2017 revenue, or $16.1 billion, up from 41% in 2011.

On behalf of loan-servicing companies, Accenture's people collect debts from homeowners who defaulted on their mortgages. For large insurance clients, doctors and nurses employed by Accenture make wellness calls to diabetes patients. For Alphabet Inc.'s Google, it oversees contractors who review content for the search giant.

""We become part of our clients' operations; we become part of the talent that's in their operations,"" says Debbie Polishook, group chief executive of Accenture Operations, which houses the company's outsourcing work.

Companies say that unloading tasks to outside firms allows employees to do more high-value jobs. Providers like Accenture tell companies they can do their work better and more cheaply, prodding executives to view labor as an on-demand resource they can rent as needed.

The breadth of services on offer from outsourcing firms is staggering. Compass Group was founded in 1941 to run factory cafeterias in wartime England, eventually branching out into corporate catering. It now employs more than 550,000 and counts among its subsidiaries firms like Eurest Services, which staffs and manages mailrooms for clients, provides them with full-time receptionists, sets up their conference rooms for meetings and operates their warehouses. Eurest's clients include Google, SAP SE and Pfizer Inc.",640,article,",coutsc,ecat,c42,c33,ccat,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,"

Home Depot -- HD-NYSE Buy -- Price $181.80 on Dec. 12 by Guggenheim

We view the home-improvement subsector as one of the most attractive in retail, given its myriad of distinct top- and bottom-line growth drivers, its healthy free-cash-flow dynamics, and the business models that keep it relatively insulated from pure-play e-commerce threats. It also has share-holding advantages, highly complex supply-chain infrastructures, and maturing and improving homegrown e-commerce offerings.

There are two key players, Home Depot and Lowe's. We apply a Buy rating to both, but think there are some small but clear differences that favor Home Depot, including the likelihood of an ongoing valuation gap between them due to HD's greater exposure to urban counties and the lucrative professional customer segment, higher levels of productivity and profitability resulting in stronger free-cash-flow dynamics, lower leverage ratios with a higher secular growth outlook, and superior infrastructure-related assets.

For Home Depot, we are initiating coverage with the previously mentioned Buy rating and a $200 price target.

PayPal Holdings -- PYPL-Nasdaq Buy -- Price $73.62 on Dec. 12 by Nomura Instinet

The company mints money, with its liquidity standing at approximately $20 billion.

The ability to invest for growth and simultaneously return capital to shareholders are hallmarks of a truly great business, and we think PayPal is capable of doing both. We believe it has the capacity to fund organic and nonorganic growth as well as buybacks, particularly with some $7 billion of liquidity on hand at the end of third-quarter 2017 and another $13 billion, more or less, at its disposal.

We, of course, expect PayPal to preserve healthy amounts of liquidity, but we now see greater buyback capacity and are modeling an incremental $2.5 billion of share repurchases from third-quarter 2018 through fourth-quarter 2019. We view the company as a compounder and believe that shares acquired now will generate significant value. We therefore raise our year-end 2018 target price to $82 from $79.

Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings -- KNX-NYSE Overweight -- Price $42.99 on Dec. 12 by Morgan Stanley

As the largest U.S. trucker, Knight-Swift is the carrier most likely to benefit from mandated electronic-logging-device upside in 2018-19. (ELD systems give companies a way to monitor and manage, in real time or in archived records, their drivers, shipments, and vehicles.) Add in the company's layers of merger synergies and potential secular opportunities, and Knight-Swift is our top pick in the freight-transportation sector.

Knight-Swift has the largest one-way truckload, or TL, exposure among big trucking carriers and has historically been the most nimble in the spot market (""add-ons"" that can account for up to 20% of one-way TL revenue). As such, we believe it is potentially the carrier most exposed to the benefits of ELD-driven pricing gains in 2018. Industry surveys point to at least mid-single digit rate increases in next year's bid season coupled with volume, utilization, and operating ratio gains, only partly offset by wage increases.

We believe that Knight-Swift's scale and exposure can make it the biggest beneficiary of ELD-mandated benefits, where our expectations are above consensus. We also see their cost synergy targets from the Knight-Swift merger as conservative and believe that the merged company can be a fast follower with new intelligent trucking technologies. Knight-Swift's diversification with the asset-light business should help in the event of a macro slowdown.

We expect revenue to grow at high-single-digit percentages (mid-single-digit price increases and low-single-digit utilization improvement) in 2018 and 2019. We see cost synergies of $75 million in 2018 and $100 million in 2019. We assume a tax rate of 38%. Our price target: $50.

Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. -- AJG-NYSE Overweight -- Price $64.79 on Dec. 12 by Barclays

Our takeaways from the recent AJG investors meeting:

1) AJG anticipates modest commercial property-and-casualty rate increases following $100 billion-plus of catastrophe losses in the third quarter of 2017.

2) Its insurance brokerage organic revenue growth is expected to accelerate slightly in fiscal 2018, driven by firmer P&C pricing and exposure growth following fiscal-year 2017 organic growth expectations of slightly above 3.6%.

(3) AJG remains focused on bolt-on acquisitions rather than large deals. The pipeline is still robust despite competition from private equity buyers.

(4) A U.S. corporate tax rate of 20% could boost AJG's annual earnings by 14% if the corporate alternative minimum tax is eliminated, but earning power could decline 7% if the 20% corporate AMT remains in the final bill.

Our price target: $70.

2017-12-16,MET,MetLife Discloses Pension Bungle --- Some Wall Street analysts assumed that payments could be 10 or more years overdue,"MetLife Inc. said it had failed to pay monthly pension benefits to possibly tens of thousands of workers in accounts that it has on its books as part of its large retirement business.

The New York insurer said it is seeking to find the retirees who are owed money and who generally have average benefits of less than $150 a month. It said it believes the group represents less than 5% of about 600,000 people who receive certain benefits from the firm.","The discovery of the overdue money and the process of locating the missing people to pay them would require strengthening reserves, MetLife said in a filing. The company also said the amount ""may be material to our results of operations.""

The workers affected by Friday's disclosure were likely owed a defined amount of monthly income when MetLife took on responsibility for the pensions from their employers, under a booming business known as pension risk transfer. MetLife didn't say in what years it had acquired these particular pension plans, how many different plans the people were involved in, and how many years of missing income was owed.

Some Wall Street analysts assumed that the payments could be 10 or more years overdue. At $150 a month for 30,000 people -- 5% of the 600,000 -- over 10 years, that could be up to $540 million.

Analyst Thomas Gallagher of Evercore ISI estimated that the fourth-quarter charge against earnings would be in the $200 million to $400 million pretax range.

Another analyst, Jay Gelb of Barclays, estimated up to $1 billion pretax, which would assume many more years of owed money.

In an investor outlook call Friday, MetLife Chief Financial Officer John C.R. Hele said that the people owed money were beneficiaries whom MetLife had ""sought to locate over time unsuccessfully.""

Mr. Hele added that the disclosure won't affect the firm's buyback plans in 2018, based on what MetLife knows now.

The company's disclosure recalls a scandal that played out across a large part of the life-insurance industry in recent years when state insurance regulators identified that there were billions of dollars of overdue life-insurance policies on insurers' books.

In 2012, MetLife agreed to pay $40 million to settle a multistate probe of its handling of death benefits, in a deal that was expected to pay more than $400 million to heirs of life-insurance policyholders.

In Friday's filing, MetLife said that it is ""improving the process used to locate a small subset of our total group annuitant population of approximately 600,000 that have moved jobs, relocated or otherwise can no longer be reached via the information provided for them."" It said it is using ""a wider set of search techniques"" made available through advances in data technology. The company said it would provide more disclosure when it reports fourth-quarter results.

The business of pension-risk transfer, in which employers with old-fashioned pension plans cut deals with insurers to take responsibility for retirees' monthly benefits, has surged in recent years.",534,article,",c341,c151,neqac,c42,cempbn,cwrkpa,gretir,c13,c15,ccat,gcat,gpersf,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,"

On December 22, 2017, (i) Waste Management Holdings, Inc. (""WM Holdings""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Waste Management, Inc. (the ""Registrant"") adopted the Waste Management Holdings, Inc. Executive Severance Protection Plan (the ""Severance Plan"") and (ii) USA Waste-Management Resources, LLC (""WM Resources""), an indirect subsidiary of the Registrant, entered into new or amended and restated (as applicable) Employment Agreements (the ""Employment Agreements"") with James C. Fish, Jr., the Registrant's President and Chief Executive Officer, Devina A. Rankin, the Registrant's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and John J. Morris, Jr., the Registrant's Senior Vice President Operations. Below is a brief summary of the material terms of the Severance Plan and Employment Agreements.","Severance Protection Plan

The Severance Plan provides for compensation following certain qualifying terminations of employment and will cover each executive officer of the Registrant except those executive officers whose pre-existing employment agreements providing for severance benefits outside of the Severance Plan will remain in place.

Under the Severance Plan, in the event a participant is terminated without ""cause"" or resigns for ""good reason"" (each, as defined in the Severance Plan), subject to execution of a release of claims and continued compliance with all restrictive covenants, he or she will be entitled to receive:

Cash severance in an aggregate amount equal to two times the sum of the participant's base salary and target annual bonus (with one half payable in a lump sum at termination, and the remaining half payable in installments over a two-year period); and

Continuation of group health benefits over a two-year period following termination.

Upon such a qualifying termination or upon the participant's death or disability, the participant will also be entitled to receive a pro rata bonus for the year of termination, determined based upon actual performance (or, in the case of a qualifying termination in connection with a ""change in control"", target performance).

Benefits to a participant under the Severance Plan are subject to reduction to the extent required by the Registrant's executive officer severance policy or if the excise tax described in Sections 280G or 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code is applicable and such reduction would place the participant in a better net after tax position. Additionally, benefits under the Severance Plan are also subject to any applicable clawback policy of the Registrant.

The Severance Plan is administered by the Management Development & Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Registrant and may be amended at any time prior to the occurrence of a ""change in control"" with no less than 12 months' notice to impacted participants.

The foregoing description of the Severance Plan is not intended to be comprehensive and is qualified in its entirety by the full terms of the Severance Plan, a copy of which has been filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1.

Employment Agreements

Messrs. Fish and Morris and Ms. Rankin have entered into Employment Agreements with WM Resources that are substantively identical, except with respect to title, reporting relationship and compensation level. With respect to Messrs. Fish and Morris, the Employment Agreement replaces and supersedes their existing employment agreement with the Registrant.

The Employment Agreements reflect the executive officers' current compensation levels, which are:

Name

1,100,000

135

%

Devina A. Rankin

$

500,000

%

John J. Morris, Jr.

$

634,000

%

Each Employment Agreement provides that the applicable executive officer will participate in the Severance Plan, but that (i) no material and adverse changes to the Severance Plan will apply to the executive officer without his or her consent, (ii) ""good reason"" and ""cause"" are defined in a manner that is substantially similar to the terms of the previous employment agreements and (iii) consistent with the terms of the previous employment agreements, the pro rata bonus payable upon termination without ""cause"" or resignation for ""good reason"" in connection with a change in control will be calculated based upon maximum, rather than target, bonus.

Each Employment Agreement contains noncompetition and nonsolicitation restrictions that apply during employment and for a two-year period following termination.

The foregoing descriptions of the Employment Agreements are not intended to be comprehensive and are qualified in their entirety by the full terms of the respective Employment Agreements, copies of which have been filed herewith as Exhibits 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4.

2017-12-26,UPS,"At UPS, It's All Hands On Deck -- WSJ","This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (December 26, 2017).

Scrambling to deliver a crush of holiday shipments before Christmas, United Parcel Service Inc. is using hundreds of its accountants, marketers and other office staff to deliver packages at the last minute.","UPS normally has ""ready teams,"" or office workers that help to sort, load or deliver packages, that it sends out to clear problem spots throughout the network. The initial sign ups are voluntary and usually set weeks before the busiest periods.

But UPS had to supplement those workers this year by calling in employees from various desk jobs with little notice. Some are delivering packages using their personal vehicles. A shift to online shopping coupled with a tight market for seasonal workers left gaps in manpower across the delivery network.

UPS spokesman Steve Gaut said ""several hundred"" office employees have been assigned to various operations roles, from sorting packages to assisting drivers as seasonal helpers, over the last few weeks. He acknowledged the number was higher than in the past but declined to say by how much.

""In some cases people were asked to change clothes and go to a local site that day or the next day because incoming volume tendered in trailer loads to specific sites was beyond the plan level,"" Mr. Gaut said. ""UPS wanted to ensure we avoided getting behind."" He said that most of those temporary field jobs have now ended.

UPS, after processing a record number of packages out of its main Louisville, Ky., hub Thursday night, is ""well-positioned to finish pre-Christmas deliveries strong, in line with customer commitments,"" Mr. Gaut said on Friday.

The company plans to continue deliveries on Saturday, including in some markets where it hasn't fully rolled out weekend service, and has contingency plans to deliver packages on Sunday ""if there are exceptional events in specific locations.""

UPS needs to react quickly to curveballs in the cadence of the peak delivery period, when daily package volumes double from normal levels, to avoid bottlenecks as the next surge of packages flow through the network. UPS works closely with retailers for months to map out how many orders are expected to flow out from which hubs and into what markets. This year, it started charging extra fees for deliveries during peak shipping days.

Like other delivery companies, UPS needs to balance the need for delivering all of its packages on time with keeping a tight lid on costs. ""Finance is trying to manage costs and maximize profits for shareholders, while operations is trying to ramp up the staffing so they can process all the volume,"" said John Haber, chief executive of the supply chain consultant Spend Management Experts. ""You have two competing factions.""

Following congestion that added a day or two to delivery promises following Cyber Monday, UPS sent ready teams to Atlanta, Denver, Kansas City and Houston to assist in processing packages. It has also asked some of its regular drivers to work 70 hours over an eight-day period, instead of 60 hours over seven days.

UPS performance has improved since, according to Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc., a software provider that analyzes shipping data. UPS deliveries through its ground network arrived on time 97.3% of the time for the week ended Dec. 16, while 98.1% of FedEx Corp.'s ground deliveries arrived on time. Both levels were equal to or better than last year.

This year's challenges were amplified by a tighter than usual market for seasonal workers. A robust economy and unemployment rate of 4.1% in November, the lowest since December 2000, is shrinking a pool of workers that can help fulfill orders for only a few weeks. ""It was more competitive in some markets to recruit and retain seasonal employees,"" Mr. Gaut said.

UPS originally targeted hiring 95,000 seasonal employees this year, about the same level as the past two years, and continued to hire some workers late into the season to address turnover. The flat hiring number came despite projection of a 5% increase in volume to about 750 million packages. UPS has said that it kept its hiring figure steady because of more automated equipment and additional workers brought on board earlier in the year.

UPS faces competition for seasonal work from a host of places, from online warehouses, retailers or other delivery companies. Rival FedEx forecast hiring 50,000 seasonal workers, close to last year's total, while Amazon.com Inc. said it was looking to hire 120,000 U.S. workers for the holiday season, the same as last year.

FedEx executives earlier this week said the carrier hasn't had any problem maintaining appropriate staffing levels during this peak season. Henry Maier, head of the company's ground business, said that ""targeted peak wage rates"" in certain regions and more automated facilities allowed FedEx to ""maintain fully staffed facilities across the entire network this peak.""

Another problem during the final week is weather. FedEx on Saturday warned of possible delays, as severe wind shear at its main Memphis hub had caused ""substantial flight and sort disruptions.""

A FedEx spokesman said Saturday evening that the carrier expects ""to make our deliveries despite flight delays.""

LAS VEGAS, Dec. 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- GB Sciences, Inc . (OTCQB: GBLX) will be represented on the Medical Cannabis in Neuroscience Panel at The Neuroscience Innovation Forum for BD&L and Investment in Therapeutics and Technology to take place at the Marines' Memorial Club, San Francisco, on the 7th of January 2018. The event is held the day before the J.P. Morgan meeting, which provides an ideal opportunity for established pharmaceutical industry giants like AbbVie , Boehringer Ingelheim , Pfizer , Sanofi , Novartis , Merck, Eli Lilly , Johnson & Johnson , and Takeda to share their latest innovations in neuroscience therapeutics with their colleagues and the investment community; refer to link at: http://www.sachsforum.com/nif-about.html .

Dr. Andrea Small-Howard , Chief Science Officer, will serve on the Medical Cannabis in Neuroscience Panel on behalf of GB Sciences to discuss the opportunities and challenges of neuroscience product development in the cannabis biotech industry. GB Sciences has previously announced the development of its proprietary cannabis-based therapy for Parkinson's disease, which will begin first-in-human testing in 2018.

""GB Sciences is honored to join representatives from Tilray , Aurora Cannabis , and Emerald Therapeutics in a discussion of new cannabis-based therapeutic options for patients with neurodegenerative conditions. For example, GB Sciences has developed a novel Parkinson's formulation, which leverages molecular synergies among multiple plant-derived active ingredients to increase its efficacy,"" explains Dr. Small-Howard. ""In the US, significant advances in research, such as this, would not be possible without access to cannabis and standardized cannabis extracts through state regulated cannabis programs; however, GB Sciences and other US cannabis biotech companies face significant hurdles at the Federal level in bringing these plant-based compounds through the traditional pharmaceutical pipeline. By contrast, Canada, where my fellow panel members do business, has a national cannabis program that creates a very different regulatory framework for product development in this field.""

The prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders in society is growing as the population ages, yet there are few effective medications available to treat these debilitating brain disorders. Neurogenerative conditions add over $500 billion to the healthcare burden in the US each year, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. Representatives of the Michael J. Fox Foundation and other patient advocacy groups are also participating in the Neuroscience Innovation Forum.

""GB Sciences is one of the small number of cannabis-based biotech companies that are committed to developing novel therapeutics for neurodegenerative patients despite the current challenges of being a US-based cannabis enterprise. Our participation in the cannabis industry is the key factor enabling us to provide Parkinson's patients with safe access to effective medications sooner than through traditional pharmaceutical pipelines,"" explains John Poss, Chairman and CEO of GB Sciences, Inc.

2017-12-27,BBY,"Business News: Retailers Aim for Happier Returns --- To win them over, consumers are being offered more ways to return merchandise","After a strong holiday shopping season, retailers are bracing for a flood of returns -- and not just at the customer-service counter.

This year traditional and online retailers have expanded the means by which consumers can return merchandise, from in-store kiosks and lockers to the mall concierge, drop-offs at grocery stores, parcel-shipping locations and at-home pickup.","""A lot more retailers are offering all the convenient options this year,"" said Amit Sharma, chief executive of Narvar, a technology firm that helps retailers including Gap Inc., Sephora and Yeti Holdings Inc. with shipping and tracking purchases and returns.

Online retailer Amazon.com Inc. said it has expanded options for in-person returns this year, with a network of 2,000 ""locker"" locations, including 400 at its Whole Foods stores, where customers can drop off items to be returned. Amazon also partnered with Kohl's Corp. stores in Chicago and Los Angeles, which are accepting returns of Amazon goods bought online.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is touting its Mobile Express Returns kiosks, located in its stores, where it says customers can complete the return process in less than five minutes and receive a refund within a day or so. They can also print a shipping label online and drop off merchandise at a designated shipping location.

Target Corp. offers similar in-store and drop-off options, and like Wal-Mart doesn't charge for returns. Kohl's and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. have comparable policies, but don't cover the cost of return shipping.

As shoppers increasingly turned to the internet for their holiday purchases this year, they were more likely to patronize e-commerce shops with speedy delivery and easy returns, analysts say. Online holiday sales are expected to top $107 billion this year, an increase of 13.8% from 2016, according to Adobe.

Returns have become a ""battleground"" among online retailers trying to attract and retain customers, said Tobin Moore, chief executive of Optoro Inc., a logistics provider that helps companies like Target and Best Buy Co. process and resell returned merchandise.

Mr. Moore estimates that goods purchased online are three times more likely to be returned as goods bought in a physical store. In total for this season, he said roughly $90 billion in holiday merchandise will be returned over the next few weeks, with more than one-third of it coming back before the new year.

With higher volumes of merchandise coming back through a wider variety of channels, analysts say handling the reverse supply chain can get costly.

""Those returns require extra manual work,"" said David Bassuk, a retail consultant with AlixPartners LLP. Every item that comes back has to be checked for damage.

One of the ways retailers lower those costs is to encourage shoppers to return items directly to a store. Items returned to the store cost a retailer roughly $3 to process and are available for resale within a day, according to AlixPartners. Items shipped back to a distribution center or third-party logistics provider cost $6 or more to process and take at least four days before they are available for resale.

Retailers see another benefit to in-store returns: customers sometimes make additional purchases after bringing back unwanted gifts.

For shoppers who choose to ship goods back, parcel carriers have readied their networks for the holiday season's aftermath. FedEx Corp. told investors in a conference call last week that it has 10,000 locations -- including Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. stores, grocers Kroger Co. and Albertsons Cos. and its own FedEx Office storefronts -- where customers can drop off items for returns. Rajesh Subramaniam, FedEx's chief marketing officer, said that ""the business of returns continues to grow in scale and complexity, especially for retailers.""

Dollar General  Announces Plans to Build New Distribution Center and Create Approximately 400 New Jobs in Longview, Texas 
 
 
GOODLETTSVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 27, 2017-- 
 
   Dollar General Corporation  (NYSE: DG) announced plans to build a new 
distribution center in Longview, Texas this morning. The 
state-of-the-art facility in Gregg County is expected to create 
approximately 400 new jobs at full capacity and serve approximately 
1,000 Dollar General  retail locations in Texas and the southeast. 
Construction should begin in early 2018 pending the receipt of all 
required governmental permits and development approvals and the absence 
of unforeseen circumstances.

   ""Dollar General  is excited to expand our supply chain and distribution 
operations in the Lone Star state with today's announcement,"" said Todd 
Vasos , Dollar General's chief executive officer. ""This facility is 
expected to support Dollar General 's growing store count in Texas where 
we already operate more than 1,400 current locations and have 
complementary operations in San Antonio. We look forward to the facility 
helping better serve our customers with value and convenience, as well 
as creating career opportunities for approximately 400 future Dollar 
General  employees. I would like to express my gratitude for our 
partnership with Texas Governor Greg Abbott, leadership in both Gregg 
County and the city of Longview and the Longview Economic Development 
Corporation , all of whom helped support this project."" 
 
 
   Dollar General  plans to make the Longview distribution center its 17(th) 
facility in the major discount retailer's distribution network and 
second in Texas. In 2014, Dollar General  announced plans to build its 
first Texas distribution center in San Antonio, Texas. Located in Bexar 
County, that facility celebrated its grand opening in 2016. 
 
 
   In addition to the full-time jobs the facility is expected to create, 
Dollar General  also anticipates a strong economic impact through 
hundreds of jobs needed to construct the nearly 1,000,000 square foot 
building. Dollar General  has selected Clayco as the project's official 
general contractor, Leo A. Daly as the architectural engineering firm 
and Elan Design as the civil engineering firm. 
 
 
   Dollar General  takes a number of factors into consideration when 
choosing distribution centers including its location, its proximity to 
Dollar General  stores, its local business environment and workforce and 
the availability of local and state economic incentives, among many 
others. 
 
 
   ""Texas' dynamic and booming economy is attracting new businesses every 
day, and we are honored to welcome Dollar General 's new distribution 
center to Longview as the latest example,"" said Texas Governor Greg 
Abbott. ""I am proud that companies like Dollar General  continue to 
invest in our top-notch workforce, and I am excited about this 
partnership and the positive impact it will have on the Longview 
community."" 
 
 
   ""A project of this magnitude absolutely requires a team effort and 
creative ideas,"" said Wayne Mansfield, Longview Economic Development 
Corporation CEO. ""We are grateful for the spirit of cooperation between 
Dollar General  and our local economic development partners in order to 
bring this project to completion. The result of this collaboration will 
provide 400 jobs for our citizens and expand our tax base. The 
successful recruitment of Dollar General  is testimony to the competitive 
advantages Longview and Gregg County possess. Dollar General 's 
reputation of success will fit well with our community."" 
 
 
   Dollar General  currently has more than 1,400 stores and over 12,000 
employees in Texas. Dollar General  currently has 15 distribution centers 
that are located in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, 
Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South 
Carolina, Texas (San Antonio), Virginia and Wisconsin. The Company's 
16(th) distribution center in Amsterdam, New York is currently under 
construction.

1233 ET - Natural gas imports into China are soaring as the country tries to back off coal use. Chinese customs data for November show gas imports reached 6.9 Bcm, up 42% from last year and up almost 13% on a month-on-month basis, according to Barclays . November coal imports showed a slight 3.6% month-on-month gain but were down 18% compared to the same month of last year. Total year-to-date coal imports into China are roughly 9% higher than last year, a level of growth the investment bank calls ""weak"" and ""contracting."" The government has been trying to phase out coal heating in favor of gas heating, but Barclays warned a gas shortage could hit this winter. If it materializes, ""coal could be the beneficiary, picking up market share and possibly driving import levels higher over the winter."" (lynn.cook@wsj.com; @LynnJCook)

1640 ET - The Canadian dollar was slightly lower Friday, moving in a sideways range for much of the day as the currency consolidates its moves in end-of-week trading. The USD was recently at C$1.2864 from C$1.2854 late Thursday, according to CQG. The Canadian dollar closed near a new six-week low against the greenback, days after the Bank of Canada 's relatively dovish tone on the Canadian economy.

A weather satellite and 18 smaller satellites were lost after a November blastoff, following more than a handful of previous botched Russian launches in recent years. But Moscow is expected to sign on to a revised international strategy, slated to be unveiled early next year, highlighting programs in low-Earth orbit. Drafted by Russia, the US and other international space station partners, the document also will emphasize moon missions and advantages of NASA 's proposed crewed platform, called Deep Space Gateway.

1555 ET - The National Grocers Association is appealing to Congress to do more to create an even playing field between the tax bill's treatment of pass-through businesses and big corporations. The membership organization of independent supermarkets, many operating as pass-through entities, writes that the Senate bill has improved the tax rates charged to the entities, but its sunset provision creates too much uncertainty. The bill's language also could prevent trusts and estates from being eligible for the pass-through deduction, it writes. ""NGA member companies are American, family-owned companies that do not have the tax advantage of offshore profit shifting,"" the organization writes in the letter Friday.

Press Release: Fitch Places Dover Corp.'s Ratings on Negative Watch


 
 
The following is a press release from Fitch Ratings : 
 ","Fitch Ratings -Chicago-08 December 2017: Fitch Ratings has placed the 'A-' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) on Dover Corporation on Rating Watch Negative following the company's announcement that it plans to spin off its wellsite business, which serves the upstream oil and gas industry. Fitch has also placed Dover's revolver and senior unsecured notes on Rating Watch Negative, and has affirmed the company's Short-Term IDR and commercial paper at 'F2'. Dover had $3.5 billion of debt outstanding as of Sept. 30, 2017. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Rating Watch: The Rating Watch Negative reflects the expected increase in Dover's financial leverage due to the loss of EBITDA from the spin-off of the wellsite business without a commensurate reduction in debt levels, and also takes into account the improvement in Dover's operating profile as a result of the spin-off. On a pro forma basis, debt/EBITDA increases to over 3x from 2.7x as of Sept. 30, 2017, compared with Fitch's prior expectation that leverage would improve to the low-2x range. Fitch expects to downgrade Dover one notch to 'BBB+' at or around the completion of the spin-off, which is expected no later than the second quarter of 2018.

Wellsite Spin-off: Following a review of strategic alternatives for the wellsite business, Dover has announced that it plans to spin off the business into a standalone, publicly traded company. Fitch Ratings believes that a spin-off of the business, which represents the majority of its energy segment, would modestly enhance the company's business profile by reducing its exposure to the cyclical upstream energy markets. Dover's wellsite business is composed of businesses that supply products for drilling, production and automation, and is estimated by Dover to generate $1 billion in revenues and $250 million of EBITDA in 2017.

Proceeds to Shareholders: The spun-off business is expected to raise $700 to 800 million of new debt and dividend the proceeds to Dover, which would use the proceeds to finance a $1 billion share repurchase program during 2018. The balance of the share repurchases would be financed with internally generated cash flow. None of the proceeds are earmarked for debt reduction, although Fitch expects the company could repay all or part of a $350 million senior note issue that matures in March 2018.

Deleveraging Slows: Pro-forma for the spin-off, and taking into account the growth in Dover's business and the repayment of up to $350 million of debt in 2018, Fitch expects debt/EBITDA in the mid-2x range at the end of 2018, up modestly from the level expected at the end of 2017 and down from 3.3x at the end of 2016. This compares with Fitch's prior expectation that leverage would improve to level closer to 2x at the end of 2018. Dover's leverage remains elevated following the completion of six acquisitions during 2016 totaling $1.6 billion.

End Market Turnaround: Fitch expects Dover will generate EBITDA growth from each of its four segments in 2017, leading to EBITDA of around $1.4 billion compared with $1.1 billion in 2016. This will be driven by a meaningful recovery in Dover's energy segment as it benefits from a turnaround in oil and gas drilling activity. Dover's fluids segment is also expected to generate strong sales and EBITDA growth supported by recent acquisitions. On a consolidated basis, Fitch expects Dover's sales growth in the mid-teens in 2017, supported by mid-single digit organic growth and acquisitions. Organic sales growth, excluding the spin-off, will likely moderate to a low single digit pace in 2018.

Margin Recovery: The EBITDA margin is expected to improve in 2017 as sales volumes improve, and to benefit in particular from the turnaround in the energy segment. Fitch expects additional margin recovery over the medium term supported by synergies from the acquired companies, continued organic sales growth and the company's ongoing efficiency initiatives.

Steady FCF: The rating is supported by healthy FCF after dividends of around $500 million in 2018, pro forma for the spin-off, due to relatively low capital intensity (capex/revenues of around 2.4%). The FCF margin has ranged from 6% to 7% historically, and is projected to remain within that range going forward. Fitch assumes FCF will be used for a combination of share repurchases and debt repayment in 2018 and that FCF will be used for a combination of acquisitions and share repurchases longer term.

DERIVATION SUMMARY

Dover is a diversified manufacturer that participates in a variety of end-markets, each of which has a different set of competitors. Parker-Hannifin Corp . ('A-'/Outlook Stable) is another diversified manufacturer at the same rating level. Parker-Hannifin is larger and more diversified than Dover, has a similar EBITDA margin (15% versus 16% for Dover) and, following a large acquisition, has similar financial leverage of around 3x moving toward 2x over three years.

Other peers include Snap-on Incorporated ('A'/Outlook Stable), which competes with Dover in vehicle repair equipment, and IDEX Corporation ('BBB+'/Outlook Negative) and ITT, Inc . ('BBB+'/Outlook Stable), which compete with Dover in pumps. Dover has higher financial leverage than these companies, though it is also larger and more diversified. No country-ceiling, parent/subsidiary or operating environment aspects impact the rating

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch's Key Assumptions Within The Agency's Rating Case for the Issuer

--Sales growth is expected to approach 14% to 15% in 2017, driven primarily by recent acquisitions and recovery in the energy segment, followed by 2.5% organic growth in 2018. The Rating Case assumes the wellsite spin-off occurs on

Jan. 1, 2018.

--EBITDA margins recover in 2017 to close to 18%, supported by a turnaround in the energy segment, but then narrow to a level closer to 17% in 2018 as a result of the mix effect of the spin-off.

--FCF after dividends at or above $500 million in 2017 and 2018.

--Debt/EBITDA is expected to track in the mid-2x range over the medium-term.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action

--Fitch could resolve the Rating Watch Negative and affirm Dover's ratings if the spin-off doesn't occur and the company continues to deleverage its balance sheet, with debt/EBITDA and funds from operations (FFO) adjusted leverage improving over the near term to a level at or below 2.0x and 3.0x, respectively.

Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action

--Fitch expects to downgrade Dover's Long-Term IDR to 'BBB+' at or around the time of the planned spin-off.

--In the absence of a spin-off, factors that could lead to a negative rating action include acquisitions or aggressive shareholder returns that prevent debt/EBITDA and funds from operations (FFO) adjusted leverage from improving over the near term to a level at or below 2.0x and 3.0x, respectively;

--A reduction in the FCF margin to below 4% to 5% due to reduced profitability or increased capex or dividends.

LIQUIDITY

Liquidity & Debt Structure: Liquidity was solid as of Sept. 30, 2017 and consisted of $322 million of cash and equivalents, of which $298 million was held outside of the U.S., and an unused $1 billion revolving credit facility expiring. Nov. 10, 2020. Dover uses this facility to backstop its CP program which had $132 million outstanding as of Sept. 30, 2017. In addition to the CP, the company had $3.4 billion of senior unsecured notes outstanding, with the nearest maturity being a $350 million note maturing in March 2018.

2017-12-08,MRK,*Fitch Rates Pfizer's Notes Offering 'A+',"8 Dec 2017 10:59 ET 
Press Release: Fitch Rates Pfizer's Notes Offering 'A+'


 
 
The following is a press release from Fitch Ratings : 
 ","Fitch Ratings -Chicago-08 December 2017: Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to Pfizer Inc .'s sterling-denominated notes offering. The notes are being offered in exchange for existing sterling-denominated notes. The ratings apply to roughly $43.1 billion of debt outstanding at Oct. 1, 2017.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Persistently High Leverage:Ã Despite Fitch's expectation that Pfizer will continue to generate stable operating performance and significant free cash flow (FCF), leverage remains high relative to the 'A+' rating level, stemming from debt funding of acquisitions and share repurchases. The company's net cash outlays for acquisitions and share repurchases were roughly $22.4 billion during 2016, while FCF was $6.8 billion. As a result, Pfizer currently has no flexibility to increase leverage further within the context of its 'A+' rating.

Manageable Patent Expiries:Ã The company's intermediate-term patent cliff is manageable. Over the next three years, roughly 15% of Pfizer 's sales are at risk of losing market exclusivity, including two of its top-selling medicines: Lyrica (approximately 9% of total firm sales) and Viagra (approximately 3%). Lyrica's U.S. patent expires in late 2018 and Viagra's in late 2017. The company's diversified business model, which also includes Essential Health, moderates the effect of the innovative portfolio's risk to patent expiries.

Advancing Pipeline:Ã During the past two years, Pfizer received regulatory approvals for Ibrance (breast cancer), Bavencio (cancer) and Eucrisa (atomic dermatitis). The company is making progress with regulatory approval submissions for late-stage pipeline candidates, such as ertugliflozin (type 2 diabetes), Besponsa/inotuzumab ozogamicin/CMC-544 (cancer), and oxycodone/naltrexone (pain). PFE is conducting clinical trials that could expand the market of its currently approved products by gaining approvals for their broader clinical use and pursuing growth opportunities that involve external sources through collaborations and acquisitions.

Possibly Divest Consumer Business:Ã Pfizer is considering divesting its consumer healthcare business. Fitch would view a divestiture as strategically positive for Pfizer , as it would narrow the company's focus on its higher margin, innovative portfolio. Regardless, the decision removes the uncertainty regarding the post-spin capital structure for the near term.

Solid FCF Generator:Ã Despite a significant cash dividend burden and a relatively volatile FCF margin, Pfizer has historically generated strong, positive FCF. Relatively stable revenues and strong EBITDA margins have helped to drive the company's performance. Fitch expects this performance to continue.

Payers Increasingly Demanding Value: While drug pricing is always near the top of contentious issues in healthcare, it has become increasingly so during the past two years. Some of the scrutiny has been self-inflicted by a few firms pursuing significant price increases on long-established drugs. Other concerns surround the high price points of recently approved innovative drugs. Pharmaceutical manufacturers will increasingly need to demonstrate the value of their therapies to payers, patients and providers with strong clinical outcomes driven by increased safety and efficacy. This dynamic will place further pressure on the research and development efforts of innovative biopharmaceutical firms.

DERIVATION SUMMARY

Pfizer 's 'A+' rating reflects the favorable aspects of the company's operating profile relative to innovative pharmaceutical industry peers Eli Lilly and Bristol Myers in terms of scale, breadth, depth, geographic reach and patent risk. Pfizer 's intermediate-term patent risk in terms of sales at risk is relatively benign and an advancing pipeline will offset some sales losses, supporting the prospects for operational and financial stability. Gross leverage is persistently around 2 times (x), largely the result of debt funding of acquisitions and share repurchases, and is very weak for the 'A+' rating.

Pfizer 's most relevant peer is Merck & Co., Inc . Merck is similar to Pfizer in terms of innovative drug sales, depth and breadth of pipeline, geographic reach and patent expiry risk. However, Pfizer 's established (branded generic) drug portfolio is significantly larger than Merck's. Fitch rates Merck 'A' with a gross debt to EBITDA sensitivity of 1.7x to 2.2x for its current rating.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include:

--Low-single-digit organic revenue growth during 2017-2018 supported by newer product sales and manageable patent expiries;

--Incrementally improving margins driven by new product sales mix and integration synergies;

--Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus dividends) of $7 billion to $7.5 billion during 2017;

--Leverage declining to 1.7x by year-end 2017 through increased operational EBITDA and debt reduction.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action

While Fitch does not anticipate a positive rating action in the near term, future developments that may individually or collectively, lead to such an action include:

--If Pfizer maintains gross debt leverage in the range of 1.0x to 1.3x;

--If the company sustains strong operational performance through the current patent expiry period, including relatively stable-to-positive trends in revenues, margins and FCF.

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action

--If Pfizer does not return to a sustainable gross debt leverage of 1.7x or lower within the next 12 to 18 months. This could stem from marketplace pressures, adverse actions from regulatory bodies, unfavorable clinical developments or its continued aggressive capital deployment strategy;

--If Pfizer pursues transactions (another large acquisition and/or significant share repurchases) that place pressure on gross leverage without the expectation of deleveraging in a timely manner.

LIQUIDITY

Strong Liquidity: PFE has strong liquidity, including full availability on a $7 billion revolving credit facility. Liquidity is bolstered by robust cash generation, with FCF for the LTM period ended Oct. 1, 2017 of $5.9 billion. The company's debt maturities are manageable with $6.4 billion maturing in 2017, $3.5 billion in 2018, $4.8 billion in 2019 and $1.5 billion in 2020. Fitch expects liquidity to remain strong throughout the ratings horizon.

Deere & Company completes acquisition of the Wirtgen Group","PR Newswire

MOLINE, Ill., Dec. 1, 2017

MOLINE, Ill., Dec. 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Deere & Company (NYSE : DE) has completed its acquisition of the Wirtgen Group, the leading manufacturer worldwide of road construction equipment. In June, Deere announced a definitive agreement to purchase the international privately-held company.

""The Wirtgen Group will enhance the size, scale and stature of our construction equipment business and will help Deere continue its global growth,"" said Samuel R. Allen , Deere & Company chairman and chief executive officer.

The Wirtgen Group has a global footprint with approximately 8,200 employees and sells products in more than 100 countries through a large network of company-owned and independent dealers. Wirtgen's product portfolio is complementary to Deere's existing construction equipment offering and establishes Deere as the industry leader in global road construction. The Wirtgen Group has premium brands across the entire road construction sector spanning milling, processing, mixing, paving, compaction and rehabilitation.

Allen said the acquisition aligns with Deere's long-term strategy to expand in both agriculture and construction -- the company's two global growth businesses.

Deere & Company (www.JohnDeere.com) is a world leader in providing advanced products and services and is committed to the success of customers whose work is linked to the land - those who cultivate, harvest, transform, enrich and build upon the land to meet the world's dramatically increasing need for food, fuel, shelter and infrastructure. Since 1837, John Deere has delivered innovative products of superior quality built on a tradition of integrity.

ST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 01, 2017-- ","Ecolab Inc . (""Ecolab "") (NYSE: ECL) today announced results as of the expiration of the early participation period at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 30, 2017 (the ""Early Participation Date""), of its offer (""Exchange Offer"") to certain eligible holders to exchange its outstanding 5.500% Notes due 2041 (CUSIP 278865 AM2) (the ""Old Notes"") for up to $375 million aggregate principal amount (the ""Exchange Cap"") of its newly issued 3.950% Notes due 2047 (""New Notes""). The 3.950% Notes due 2047 being offered in the Exchange Offer will be a further issuance of, and will be in addition to, the 3.950% Notes due 2047 (the ""Original 2047 Notes"") Ecolab issued for cash on November 27, 2017, in the aggregate principal amount of $325 million.

The Exchange Offer is being conducted on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in a confidential offering memorandum dated November 16, 2017, and related letter of transmittal (together, the ""Exchange Offer Documents"").

The Total Exchange Consideration to be received in the Exchange Offer for each $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Early Participation Date is set forth in the table below. The Total Exchange Consideration will be rounded to the nearest cent per $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes and includes an amount of $50.00 per $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes tendered and accepted for exchange by Ecolab (the ""Early Participation Amount""). Since the aggregate principal amount of Old Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Participation Date resulted in the Exchange Cap being exceeded, Old Notes tendered will be subject to the proration procedures described in the Exchange Offer Documents, there will be no Final Settlement Date with respect to the Exchange Offer, and no additional tenders of Old Notes will be accepted for purchase in the Exchange Offer after the Early Participation Date.

Although participants in the Exchange Offer will not hold New Notes prior to the applicable settlement date, the first interest payment on the New Notes will include the interest accrued from the issuance date of the Original 2047 Notes to the applicable settlement date. Further, each holder whose Old Notes are accepted for exchange will receive a cash payment (reduced as described in the following sentence) representing interest, if any, that has accrued from the most recent interest payment date in respect of the Old Notes up to, but not including, the applicable settlement date; provided, that, holders of Old Notes will not receive accrued and unpaid interest that is due and payable on the applicable settlement date if the accrued and unpaid interest that is due and payable on the applicable settlement date on the New Notes exceeds the accrued and unpaid interest that is payable on the applicable settlement date on the Old Notes. Interest payable on the Old Notes up to, but not including, the applicable settlement date will be reduced by the interest accrued on the New Notes up to, but not including, the applicable settlement date.

2017-12-02,DTE,T-Mobile Debt Nearly Investment-Grade in S&P's Eyes -- Market Talk,"1610 ET - T-Mobile 's strong financial performance earns it a credit upgrade from S&P, lifting the No. 3 US wireless carrier to double-B-plus from double-B. That puts it on the cusp of investment-grade territory. Better debt ratios in relation to adjusted earnings and free operating cash flow helped T-Mobile 's case, as did called-off merger talks with Sprint . The ratings service adds that cash pumped back to shareholders and spectrum licenses shouldn't rock the boat too much. S&P gives T-Mobile a stable outlook and calls another upgrade unlikely, though its rating could climb if T-Mobile significantly grows postpaid market share and widens its margins. (andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com; @drewfitzgerald)","1605 ET - Some investors are wagering that stock market turbulence will continue. Options volume on the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, hit an all-time high on Friday, according to Trade Alert, as investor jitters swept through the stock market, sending major US indexes lower after hitting record highs on Thursday. The VIX index jumped higher and above 14 during the day and hovered at 11.36 in late trading as markets recovered much of their losses. At least one giant options bet exchanged hands today, which will cash in if the VIX hits 25 by this January, according to Trade Alert's Fred Ruffy. (gunjan.banerji@wsj.com; @gunjanjs)

1557 ET - Net bets on higher copper prices inched up during the week ended Tuesday, according to the latest data from the CFTC. Bullish bets by hedge funds and other speculative investors outnumbered bearish bets by 81,751 contracts, increasing less than 1% from the previous week's total of 81,072. Copper prices have pulled back from nearly three-year highs in recent sessions amid concerns that demand from China, the world's largest consumer, will slow moving forward. They are still up more than 20% for the year. (amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com; @AmrithRamkumar)

1551 ET - Net bets on higher gold prices rose 15% to their highest level in two months during the week ended Tuesday, according to data from the CFTC. Bullish bets by hedge funds and other speculative investors outnumbered bearish bets by 204,204 contracts, the most since the week ended Sept 26, when net bullish bets stood at 204,731. Gold prices touched $1,300 early in the week before retreating after economic data that analysts said should leave the Fed on track to raise interest rates in December and multiple times in 2018. Gold struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets like Treasurys as borrowing costs rise. Net bullish bets are still roughly 30% off their year-to-date highs from mid-September.

1512 ET - Saxo Bank says OPEC and non-OPEC show of unity in Vienna was a classic example of realpolitik with the economic importance of keeping prices supported outweighing fraught geopolitical relations. But ""attention will now increasingly turn to the US with the market trying to gauge the impact on production growth from a price trading well above $50/b,"" the bank says. Weekly production estimates continue to reach new highs and during the past three weeks US drillers have added back almost half of the rigs that were pulled during the previous three months, it adds.

1457 ET - Nintendo 's latest mobile game isn't living up to analysts' expectations, data from Sensor Tower suggest. When Nintendo announced in October that its Animal Crossing franchise was coming to smartphones, analysts predicted the game would boost Nintendo 's mobile revenue, which has made up a relatively small part of the company's overall business. But Sensor Tower says ""Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp"" grossed only $10M in its first nine days, compared with $33M for ""Fire Emblem Heroes"" and $24M for ""Super Mario Run"" over the same period. Nintendo began making mobile apps in 2016 and now has four, including the social app ""Miitomo."" Other than Super Mario Run, which costs $10 to download, the company's apps are free and generate revenue from sales of virtual goods. (sarah.needleman@wsj.com; @saraheneedleman)

1439 ET - House Republicans file a bill to overturn a new regulation clamping down on payday lenders, another affront to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that came under Trump-appointee, Mick Mulvaney , this week. The lawmakers plan to use a legislative tool known as the Congressional Review Act to thwart the new rule. Today the White House appointed Brian Johnson, an aide to Rep. Jeb Hensarling, as Senior Advisor to assist Mulvaney at the CFPB. Mulvaney and Hensarling are harsh critics of the CFPB and have in the past proposed various steps to weaken the independent agency. Congress last month successfully used a CRA resolution to kill the so-called arbitration rule, which would have made it easier for consumers to sue banks. It was the first CFPB rule to be overturned by Congress. (yuka.hayashi@wsj.com; @TokyoWoods)

1419 ET - US freight operators are signaling higher shipping prices are coming as strong demand meets increasingly strained transportation supply. YRC Worldwide CEO James Welch told a Credit Suisse investor conference, ""Capacity is tight.

The blue-chip index had fallen as many as 350 points earlier in the trading session after ABC News reported that former national security adviser Michael Flynn was expected to testify that President Donald Trump ""directed him to make contact with the Russians."" US stocks then came off their session lows, with traders attributing the recovery to both the tendency throughout the year of investors to scoop up stocks following selloffs and reports that Senate Republicans had enough votes to pass a closely-watched tax bill.

1336 ET - US regulatory approval of Mylan's biosimilar Herceptin will not only provide a sales jolt but also set the stage for the generic-drug company's to ramp up sales of complex products, according to Barclays . FDA approves Ogivri, Mylan's biosimilar version of Herceptin, on Friday for treatment of certain breast and stomach cancers. Herceptin, from Roche, has about $3B in US sales, Barclays says. The approval suggests Mylan and partner Biocon have overcome manufacturing issues that also set back approval of a biosimilar version of cancer-support drug Neulasta. Approval of such biosimilars, along with generic versions of drugs like Restasis, Estrace and Advair, would give Mylan a portfolio of ""high-value"" complex products that ""can provide a growth bridge"" for the company until US pricing pressures subside, Barclays says. Mylan shares rise 5.4%. (jonathan.rockoff@wsj.com; @jonathanrockoff)

1330 ET - US traders have brushed off concerns about a US confrontation with North Korea all year. Even the launch of a new and more powerful missile this week didn't rattle markets. An analysis by Goldman Sachs finds Trump's tweets about North Korea that reference the country or Kim Jong-un (aka Rocket Man) matter far more than missile or nuclear tests per se: ""The concurrent rise in the VIX suggests that tweets alone are enough to generate market concerns. Conversely, there were several missile tests earlier this year that failed to elicit much reaction on Twitter ."" (chris.dieterich@wsj.com)

2017-12-01,FE,Power Shift Drives a Slide in Prices,"The rapid rise of wind and natural gas as sources of electricity is roiling U.S. power markets, forcing more companies to close older generating plants.

Wholesale electricity prices are trending near historic lows in parts of the country with competitive power markets, as demand for electricity remains stagnant and newer, less-expensive generating facilities continue to come online.","The changing American electricity landscape is pressuring power companies to shed unprofitable plants and reshape their portfolios to favor the new winners. Texas is an example.

Citing low gas prices and the proliferation of renewables such as wind and solar, Vistra Energy Corp., a vestige of the former Energy Future Holdings Corp., said it would retire three coal-fired facilities in Texas by early next year and that it plans to merge with independent power producer Dynegy Inc.

Exelon Corp., the country's largest owner of nuclear power plants, placed its Texas subsidiary under bankruptcy protection in November, saying ""historically low power prices within Texas have created challenging market conditions for all power generators.""

The average wholesale power price was less than $25 per megawatt hour last year on the grid that coordinates electricity distribution across most of Texas, according to the operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or Ercot. A decade ago, it was $55.

Prices have fallen a similar amount on PJM Interconnection, the power grid that serves some or all of 13 states, including Pennsylvania and Ohio. A megawatt hour there traded for $29.23 last year, the lowest level since 1999, which is as far back as the grid's independent market monitor tracks prices.

The falling prices have been felt primarily by wholesale generation companies, who sell their power to utilities, and generally haven't trickled down to businesses and homeowners. But the lower prices have allowed many utilities to avoid raising customer rates while making substantial investments in modernizing aging electric transmission networks.

The price drop on PJM reflects the construction of dozens of new gas-burning power plants, spurred by the abundance of the fuel due to the shale drilling boom. In 2006, 8% of the electricity on PJM was generated by natural gas. In 2016, it was 27%.

Weak demand for electricity also has played a role, as Americans purchase more energy-efficient appliances and companies shave power use to cut costs. Last year, power demand on PJM grew a mere 0.3% after falling the two previous years.

The resulting market reality -- more power available to buyers of roughly the same number of megawatts -- has most-acutely impacted older coal and nuclear plants, which are struggling to provide competitively priced power. It has even begun to affect older natural-gas-fired facilities that have higher costs.

""Generators are just fighting for existing market share,"" said Ari Peskoe, a senior fellow in electricity law at Harvard Law School. ""The aging fleet of coal and nuke generators, combined with low prices, makes this intense.""

FirstEnergy Corp., an Akron, Ohio-based utility, said late last year it was exiting competitive power markets. It is selling four natural-gas plants and hopes to sell coal and nuclear plants that provide power in the PJM wholesale marketplace.

This summer, power company NRG Energy Inc. announced a transformation plan that included selling up to $4 billion in power generation.

West of the Mississippi River, power markets also have been upended by the rapid growth of wind, as the cost of generating power from wind turbines is falling. In 2016, all of the new generation built in the Southwest Power Pool, a grid that covers an area from Louisiana to Montana, was wind, gas and solar. The vast majority of the retirements were coal and nuclear plants.

Wind is the fastest-growing source of power on Texas' grid. Last year, wind generated 15% of the electricity in Ercot, more than nuclear power, which accounted for 12%. By 2019, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin's Energy Institute expect wind to surpass coal as Ercot's second-largest source of electricity.

""Solar and wind are now competitive with natural gas-fired generation,"" said Curt Morgan, Vistra's chief executive. Mr. Morgan said that while he thinks natural gas will be the ""workhorse"" of U.S. electricity markets for at least the next decade, in Texas ""I think it's going to be a while before you see another gas plant built in Ercot.""

Last week, Siemens AG said it was cutting 6,900 jobs, in large part because it has overestimated demand for its giant power turbines.

The changes have been felt primarily in competitive power markets, which exist in many parts of the U.S., including California, Texas and the Midwest. In those areas, wholesale electricity is sold through daily auctions that favor the least-expensive sources of power, and it is then purchased by utilities and others.

Some regions of the U.S. don't have competitive power markets, and instead power is generated entirely by utilities and sold to customers at rates regulated by state officials. Even in regulated markets, changes are afoot. Earlier this week, WEC Energy Group Inc. said it was closing its Pleasant Prairie coal plant in Wisconsin, citing a desire to add more gas and solar generation.

As companies face price pressures, some have sought government aid. Exelon has been pushing states to create new subsidies for them.

The Trump administration is aiming to provide a lifeline to the coal and nuclear industries through several proposals, including a plan to assist power plants that provide constant, baseload power to ensure energy security.

But that proposal, which has to be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, has been criticized as anticompetitive and unlikely to reverse market trends.

An analysis by investment bank Lazard shows that on an unsubsidized basis and over the lifetime of a facility in North America, it costs about $60 to generate a megawatt hour of electricity using a combined-cycle natural-gas plant, compared with $102 burning coal and nearly $150 using nuclear. By that criteria, Lazard estimates electricity from utility-scale solar and wind facilities is even cheaper than gas.

A megawatt hour of electricity from utility-scale crystalline solar comes in at $49.50 and wind at $45. That metric carries a caveat, however: It doesn't factor in that wind and solar are more intermittent producers of power than conventional generation sources, as the sun doesn't always shine and the wind doesn't always blow.

Chris Moser, senior vice president of operations at NRG, said the challenge in many parts of the U.S. now is to ensure a diverse mix of power resources so that if one encounters issues, others can fill in.

2017-12-19,JNPR,Press Release: TELEHOUSE America Selects Juniper Networks for Advanced Automation across its Multicloud Data Center Environment,"TELEHOUSE America Selects Juniper Networks for Advanced Automation across its Multicloud Data Center Environment

Juniper's Virtual Chassis deployment bridges multiple data centers through EVPN-VXLAN technology, while increasing operational efficiencies through automation provided by Juniper's programmable OS and virtualization solution","TOKYO, JAPAN--(Marketwired - December 18, 2017) - Juniper Networks (NYSE: JNPR), an industry leader in automated, scalable and secure networks, today announced that TELEHOUSE America, a KDDI group company that provides robust and carrier-neutral data center services in the US, has deployed Juniper Networks to build a multi-tenant infrastructure that bridges its data centers across multiple US locations, while providing high-performing and secure connectivity within and outside its facilities.

One of TELEHOUSE America's mission is to provide strong connectivity and stable network services for its customers. To this end, the company was seeking for a system to provision connectivity promptly, accurately and reliably; and to allow monitoring and management with minimum time and resources. With Juniper Networks(R) QFX5100 line of Switches supporting the multi-tenant architecture that uses EVPN-VXLAN technology, TELEHOUSE America has drastically reduced its operational workload and simplified software configuration using SDN technology.

After an extensive review process, the QFX5100 line was identified as the only product line capable of successfully implementing EVPN-VXLAN technology across TELEHOUSE America's remote data centers.

In addition to supporting the required multi-tenant architecture, Juniper's Virtual Chassis fabric technology and the Junos(R) OS API enabled new levels of automation for TELEHOUSE America, while also significantly reducing total cost of ownership and increasing long-term return on investments.

News Highlights: 


   -- TELEHOUSE America picked Juniper's QFX5100 Ethernet Switch as the basis 
      of a new multi-tenant architecture utilizing EVPN-VXLAN technology across 
      two locations in New York City. 
 
   -- The company also replaced its conventional three-layered network 
      architecture with Juniper's Virtual Chassis fabric technology and the 
      open standards-based Junos OS API to automate many work streams. This has 
      resulted in being able to execute software configuration in as little as 
      five minutes. 
 
   -- Featuring versatile integration capabilities, the Junos OS also assures 
      long-term network scalability, especially as TELEHOUSE America considers 
      expansion across the US, Europe and the Pacific Rim.

2017-12-19,HSY,"Business News: Hershey, Campbell Soup Bulk Up With Big Deals on Snacks","Campbell Soup Co. and Hershey Co. plan to buy smaller, higher-growth snack companies in the biggest efforts yet to broaden their cupboards well beyond soup and candy.

Campbell said it would acquire Snyder's-Lance Inc. for $6.1 billion, including debt, the largest deal in the company's history. Hershey said it would buy Amplify Snack Brands Inc. in a deal valued at $1.6 billion, including debt. It is Hershey's largest deal, also.","Campbell and Hershey, iconic American mainstays, are under growing pressure from consumers looking for healthier options as well as more portable, convenient alternatives to cooking. The two food giants have taken steps in recent years through acquisitions and product launches to reinvent themselves. Peers such as General Mills Inc. and Kraft Heinz Co. have also felt the impact of families swapping full meals for snacks and replacing packaged food with fresher alternatives.

U.S. snack sales rose to $89 billion last year, growing at a compound average of 3% annually over the prior three years, according to market research firm IRI. That makes it a rare bright spot in an otherwise bleak market for packaged food.

Campbell Chief Executive Denise Morrison said there is ""a fundamental change in consumer behavior . . . the lines between snacks and meals are blurring."" She said Campbell will now make everything ""from soup to nuts,"" with 46% of its sales coming from snacks after the deal, and just over one-quarter from soup. Reaching that tipping point, she said, would further insulate the company from the depressed trends in soup and its other meal-oriented brands like SpaghettiOs.

Campbell initially approached Snyder's-Lance with an offer last summer. From 2012 to 2016, Snyder's-Lance's sales rose at an average of 11.5% a year, while Campbell, which already owns snack brands like Goldfish crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies, has posted sales declines in the past three fiscal years.

During Ms. Morrison's tenure as CEO, Campbell has bought other health-focused brands like Bolthouse Farms carrots and refrigerated juices and Plum Organics baby food. Earlier this month, it completed its acquisition of Pacific Foods, a maker of organic soup and other meals. But the purchase of Snyder's-Lance's Hanover pretzels and Kettle chips highlights its intention to focus on snacking, as well as fresh and organic foods.

Hershey CEO Michele Buck, who stepped into the role in March, said Monday's deal shows the 100-year-old company's ""seriousness and intent"" of becoming a broader snacking company. The addition of SkinnyPop popcorn and other savory snacks to Hershey's past purchases of Krave jerky and BarkTHINS gives the company a strong foothold in the snacking sector, she said in an interview.

Both Campbell and Hershey said these deals will also allow them to save money by combining some operations.

Industry analysts say a need for growth, coupled with newfound clarity on corporate taxes, are likely to spur more deals by big food companies in the coming year.

In recent months, Kellogg Co. said it would pay $600 million for RXBar, which makes protein bars using simple ingredients. M&M's candy maker Mars Inc. made a minority investment in KIND LLC, whose fruit-and-nut bars have stolen sales from candy at store checkout lanes. And Conagra Brands Inc. paid $250 million for the maker of Angie's Boomchickapop flavored popcorn.

U.S. snack sales rose to $89 billion last year, growing at a compound average of 3% annually over the prior three years, according to market research firm IRI. That makes it a rare bright spot in an otherwise bleak market for packaged food.

Campbell Chief Executive Denise Morrison said there is ""a fundamental change in consumer behavior . . . the lines between snacks and meals are blurring."" She said Campbell will now make everything ""from soup to nuts,"" with 46% of its sales coming from snacks after the deal, and just over one-quarter from soup. Reaching that tipping point, she said, would further insulate the company from the depressed trends in soup and its other meal-oriented brands like SpaghettiOs.

Campbell initially approached Snyder's-Lance with an offer last summer. From 2012 to 2016, Snyder's-Lance's sales rose at an average of 11.5% a year, while Campbell, which already owns snack brands like Goldfish crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies, has posted sales declines in the past three fiscal years.

During Ms. Morrison's tenure as CEO, Campbell has bought other health-focused brands like Bolthouse Farms carrots and refrigerated juices and Plum Organics baby food. Earlier this month, it completed its acquisition of Pacific Foods, a maker of organic soup and other meals. But the purchase of Snyder's-Lance's Hanover pretzels and Kettle chips highlights its intention to focus on snacking, as well as fresh and organic foods.

Hershey CEO Michele Buck, who stepped into the role in March, said Monday's deal shows the 100-year-old company's ""seriousness and intent"" of becoming a broader snacking company. The addition of SkinnyPop popcorn and other savory snacks to Hershey's past purchases of Krave jerky and BarkTHINS gives the company a strong foothold in the snacking sector, she said in an interview.

Both Campbell and Hershey said these deals will also allow them to save money by combining some operations.

Industry analysts say a need for growth, coupled with newfound clarity on corporate taxes, are likely to spur more deals by big food companies in the coming year.

In recent months, Kellogg Co. said it would pay $600 million for RXBar, which makes protein bars using simple ingredients. M&M's candy maker Mars Inc. made a minority investment in KIND LLC, whose fruit-and-nut bars have stolen sales from candy at store checkout lanes. And Conagra Brands Inc. paid $250 million for the maker of Angie's Boomchickapop flavored popcorn.

2017-12-20,LNT,Press Release: Alliant Energy to build English Farms Wind Farm,"Alliant Energy to build English Farms Wind Farm

Company's wind expansion on track to power up to 430,000 Iowa homes","PR Newswire

CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa, Dec. 19, 2017

CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa, Dec. 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Alliant Energy 's Iowa energy company will add more clean energy with the acquisition of the English Farms Wind Farm. The company finalized an agreement with developer Tradewind Energy for the 170-megawatt project, located in Poweshiek County in central Iowa.

""Wind energy is a win for Iowans,"" said Doug Kopp , president of Alliant Energy's Iowa energy company. ""The benefits of this project help customers through reductions in emissions and fuel cost. It gives landowners lease payments to help on the farm and it helps communities through increased local tax revenue for schools and community services.""

Alliant Energy will build and own English Farms Wind Farm, with major construction starting in 2018. This is one of several wind farms the company is building to deliver cost-competitive, clean energy to customers.

Alliant Energy received approval in 2016 to add up to 500 megawatts of wind energy in Iowa. The company has requested a similar wind expansion from the Iowa Utilities Board again in 2017. With these combined projects, customers will get more than one-third of their energy from wind by the end of 2020.

This overall wind expansion represents a roughly $1.8 billion investment and adds up to 1,000 megawatts of new wind generation in Iowa. Together, that's enough to power up to 430,000 Iowa homes a year.

""It has been extremely rewarding to work with Poweshiek County officials, landowners and community members,"" said Jeff Hammond, senior development manager for Tradewind Energy. ""We are very proud to partner with Alliant Energy , which is contributing to the transformation of Iowa's electric power supply.""

English Farms Wind Farm facts: 


   -- Number of turbines: 69 
 
   -- Size of project: 170 megawatts 
 
   -- Annual energy output: enough for about 50,000 homes a year 
 
   -- Local tax benefits: approximately $47 million in the next 30 years 
 
   -- Landowner payments: approximately $12 million in the next 30 years 

Alliant Energy Corporation 's Iowa utility subsidiary, Interstate Power and Light Company (IPL), utilizes the trade name of Alliant Energy . The Iowa utility is based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and provides electric service to 490,000 retail customers and natural gas service to 220,000 retail customers. The employees of Alliant Energy focus on delivering the energy solutions and exceptional service their customers and communities expect -- safely, efficiently and responsibly. Alliant Energy Corporation is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol LNT and is a component of the S&P 500. For more information, visit alliantenergy.com.

2017-12-06,C,"Banking & Finance: AmEx, JPMorgan to Keep Marriott Cards","JPMorgan Chase & Co. and American Express Co. will remain credit-card issuers for the Marriott International Inc. rewards program, the hotel chain said Tuesday.

The longstanding U.S. partnership, in which JPMorgan issues Marriott credit cards and American Express issues Starwood Hotels & Resorts credit cards, was in question after Marriott purchased Starwood last year and began negotiations with the issuers.","One possibility in the process was merging the rewards programs down to a single issuer, which would have pushed all of the roughly $60 billion spent on the hotel chain's credit cards in 2016 to one lender.

Maintaining the status quo is a win for AmEx in particular; the Starwood program is the card issuer's second-largest co-brand program, following Delta Air Lines Inc. Some AmEx investors were nervous about the prospect of AmEx losing this relationship just as the company is showing signs of rebounding from the loss of the Costco Wholesale Corp. partnership that was taken over by Citigroup Inc. and Visa Inc. in 2016.

Starwood accounted for 5% of AmEx's world-wide loans and 2% of its billings in the second half of 2016, according to AmEx data. The Starwood program also is estimated to account for about 4% to 5% of AmEx's earnings, said Mark DeVries, a Barclays PLC analyst.

""The uncertainty had been an overhang on [AmEx] shares,"" Mr. DeVries wrote in a noteTuesday. ""But the announcement today resolves that uncertainty and effectively takes the worst case scenario off the table for"" AmEx.

Holding onto the account also helps departing AmEx Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault to leave on a relatively strong note and removes a large potential problem for Stephen Squeri, who takes over as AmEx chief in February.

Travel co-brand programs have lost some of their cachet with consumers in recent years as banks have rolled out more generous rewards on general-purpose credit cards.

Consumers can use those cards to redeem points for a variety of rewards and travel expenses as opposed to limiting them to certain hotel chains or airlines.

The programs have also become costlier for lenders to win. Hotels and airlines have gained more leverage over card issuers in negotiations in recent years following consolidations in those sectors. In a presentation earlier this year, Stephanie Linnartz, Marriott's global chief commercial officer, said that there would be ""upside at contract renewals"" for the hotel chain.

Marriott said in its announcement Tuesday that it expects to introduce new co-brand cards starting in 2018 with improved benefits aimed at a mix of spenders, including affluent and small-business customers.",444,article,",neqac,c333,c33,ccat,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,"

Chief commercial officer Vincent Clerc told local media Hamburg Sud 's fleet may be re-flaged in Singapore and that he expects more cargo to go through the island state. Maersk 's transhipment volume through Singapore has gone up 69% over the past three years to more than 4.5 million containers.

""The intent of the tax reform is to lift all boats,"" Maredia tells investors at a Barclays Capital conference. ""I think Sprouts would recommend something similar to our board.""

1528 ET - David Rosenberg , the widely read chief economist at Gluskin Sheff , says the Bank of Canada has set a ""very high"" bar to move off the sidelines and raise rates again. He says in note to clients it will be ""long time"" before BoC raises rates again, adding a number of uncertainties covering Nafta, housing, mortgage-financing rules among other things, ""are simply ""far too wide."" Higher interest rates ""would do more to compound these uncertainties that Poloz et al are concerned about than alleviate them."" He also takes aim at economists indicating Canadian monetary policy might be too loose, saying raising rates now would trigger recession risks. He says he expects further weakness for C$, with a wait-and-see BoC and the Federal Reserve intent on raising rates. (paul.vieira@wsj.com; @paulvieira)

1349 ET - Google scored a small victory this week when a California state judge dismissed class-action claims that the internet company pays women less than men and doesn't give women equal opportunity for career advancement. Superior Court Judge Mary Wiss in San Francisco said the lawsuit was too broad because it was brought on behalf of all women who worked for Google in the state. Three women sued the company in September for unfair pay and promotion practices at the company. But Google 's win may be short lived. James Finberg , a lawyer for the three women, said he will file an amended complaint by Jan. 3 ""that addresses the court's concerns and makes clear that Google violates the California Equal Pay Act by paying women less than men for substantially equal work in nearly every job classification.""

1325 ET - Whether the Trump administration should impose tariffs on imported solar panels and cells, as the International Trade Commission is recommending, is a hot topic in the solar world. The Office of the US Trade Representative received nearly 4,000 comments ahead of a Wednesday hearing on the issue. Juergen Stein, CEO of SolarWorld Americas , one of the embattled solar manufacturers requesting protections, lobbied for tariffs saying ""the President has the power to help bring the US solar manufacturing industry back from the brink."" The Solar Energy Industries Association disagrees, saying tariffs ""would put tens of thousands of American workers out of jobs."" A decision from Trump is due in January.

1308 ET - Analysts say UnitedHealth is paying at the high end for DaVita 's medical group, based on its disappointing recent results, but they argue the deal makes strategic sense and the asset is a rare one. JPMorgan says the $4.9B price is around 14 times its estimate for the medical group's 2018 EBITDA, but the shift away from paying medical providers fees for each service ""places material strategic value on integrated (and particularly capitated) medical groups"" like DaVita 's. Matt Borsch at BMO Capital Markets says ""the seemingly lofty multiple that UNH will pay to acquire...is distorted by the earnings improvement potential we see under UNH,"" both in the medical group's own results and the related benefits to UnitedHealth 's Medicare Advantage performance.

1304 ET - Bank of Nova Scotia economist Derek Holt tells clients the uncertainty over Nafta is weighing heavily on Bank of Canada policymakers, and perhaps moreso than Wednesday's rate-policy decision is letting on. BoC remains on hold when it comes to rates, Holt says, and is more mindful of the tenuous state of Nafta talks relative to economic data. Holt says BoC is likely more focused on the risk of raising rates based on economic data, only to find out later Trump makes good on his threat to begin the Nafta withdrawal process. ""There is obviously a limit to the point to which monetary policy can be put on hold by never ending uncertainties, but I simply don't buy that the data is screaming out that this limit is being breached now,"" Holt tells clients.

1240 ET - One factor sapping US shale company profits are the extravagant prices operators have paid to lease land for drilling in places such as the Permian Basin in Texas. Many drop out those land-acquisition costs from the break-even-price calculations they tout to shareholders. While most shale operators claim they have hundreds, if not thousands, of well locations they say can muster a 10% profit margin or more, the number of in-the-money wells is far smaller when costs for land, pipelines and other infrastructure and overhead is factored in. Pioneer Natural Resources said in 2016 that its production costs at some wells were $2.25 a barrel, a level that would rival Saudi Arabia's. It didn't include costs for taxes, overhead and finding and developing new wells. That year, Pioneer reported $556 million in losses, spending $1.24 for every $1 it took in from operations. (bradley.olson@wsj.com; @BradNews)

1239 ET - Shareholder letters have rolled in at US shale companies this fall, many of them demanding that operators chart a new path to delivering returns to shareholders. At Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy , Invesco, its fourth-largest shareholder at just under 5%, and others began peppering CEO David Hager with suggestions about improving returns. Hager said the driller conducted a review and determined it can probably start to pay a dividend or buyback shares by selling off billions in noncore assets and not plow all the money back into new wells. ""The industry was not nearly as efficient with its capital as it should have been,"" Hager said. (lynn.cook@wsj.com; @LynnJCook)

1220 ET - US oil production has surged so quickly that it appears on course to surpass 10M barrels a day in 2018, breaking a record set in 1970. But as companies have pumped more, investors have started to pull back. About $800M flowed out of energy-focused equity funds for the year through November, compared with inflows of over $6B in 2016, according to fund-data tracker EPFR Global. Oil prices have been rising since June, but shale stock prices haven't followed. Investors are concerned about executive pay in particular. In the last decade, CEOs at 15 of the biggest oil-and-gas companies were paid $2.8B, despite providing total shareholder returns of 2.7% a year, and saw pay exceeding 100% of their targets in 95% of pay years in that period, according to Evercore ISI. (lynn.cook@wsj.com; @LynnJCook)

1214 ET - As a group, US shale companies have been forecasting they are on the brink of generating free cash flow-taking in more revenue from operations than they spend on new investments-for the first time since 2014, when oil traded over $100 a barrel. Since then, they have largely repeatedly moved those goal posts back. Wood Mackenzie estimates that if oil prices hover around $50, shale companies won't generate positive cash flow as a group until 2020. Returns from individual wells can be good, but shale wells tend to pop online with a gush and then peter out fast. That's meant operators sink profits back into more new wells that can take another two years to become profitable, with shareholders told to hang on for a payday. (lynn.cook@wsj.com ; @LynnJCook)

1210 ET - Trent Stedman of Seattle-based Columbia Pacific Advisors writes in a letter to Continental Resources that listening to CEOs outline big production growth plans ""has become as unpleasant as fingernails on a chalkboard."" Continental CEO Harold Hamm says he agrees with the letter's sentiment and shared it with his board. He writes back: ""You are truly preaching to the choir."" Continental has drilled few new wells this year, but remains on track to grow output. Stedman says he has asked several shale producers why they appear hellbent on giving away their product as fast as possible at low prices. ""Some would say, 'We know it's bad economics, but it's what The Street wants,'"" he says. ""We wanted to provide another voice that says, 'We've got skin in the game, and we don't want to see you do that.'"" (lynn.cook@wsj.com ; @LynnJCook)

Company ranks No. 6 among nearly 700 companies evaluated by the Drucker Institute","Innovation and Financial Strength scores in Top 2.5% of all NYSE and NASDAQ Listed Companies 


CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 06, 2017-- 

In the inaugural ranking of the Most Effectively Managed Companies released by the Drucker Institute, The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) was ranked sixth among hundreds of Fortune 500, S&P 500 and other large-cap companies evaluated on overall corporate effectiveness. Other top ranked companies include Amazon.com Inc ., Apple Inc ., Alphabet Inc ., Johnson & Johnson , IBM and Microsoft, Inc .

P&G earned recognition in the premier ranking based on exemplary scores in 37 indicators categorizing performance in Customer Satisfaction, Employee Engagement and Development, Innovation, Social Responsibility and Financial Strength. Underlying these areas are fifteen business principles developed by professor, management consultant and author, the late Peter Drucker, that specify what drives corporate ""effectiveness,"" which he defined as ""doing the right things well.""

""Our ranking offers a breakthrough view of corporate effectiveness by integrating performance across areas too often viewed in isolation,"" said Zachary First, Executive Director of the Drucker Institute. ""P&G is one of only six companies this year that excels at the whole picture, with all five component scores at least one standard deviation above the mean. They are in an elite group that is well positioned for long-term, sustained success.""

When establishing criteria, The Drucker Institute's primary objective was to create a method of evaluation that provides executives and investors with a line of sight into the holistic, longer-term perspective for a company.

""We are honored by this recognition which supports our view of what's working well at P&G ,"" said David Taylor , P&G 's Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Every day P&G people work to serve consumers with superior brands and reward shareholders with balanced, sustainable long-term growth and value creation. This recognition is further validation that we are on the right track.""

P&G secured an especially strong score in Financial Strength, a category reflecting factors such as market share, total shareholder return and earnings for common shareholders, among others. Of nearly 700 companies included in the ranking, P&G led every company for aggregate market share, inclusive of the number of categories and margin of leadership.

Innovation is at the heart of P&G , another area reflected by an especially strong score in the rankings. P&G is constantly working to delight consumers and continue to grow product categories that meet consumer needs through deep consumer understanding and superior technology development.

P&G 's unwavering focus on longevity has generated business success and earned external recognition across numerous performance benchmarking categories. P&G is widely known for Customer Satisfaction and Social Responsibility, stemming from attentiveness to market trends and commitment to sustainability and citizenship efforts. Another element of the ranking, Employee Engagement and Development is crucial to the Company's success -- cultivating and rewarding talent through a strong, inclusive, merit-based culture that drives success both from within the company and the broader marketplace.

The late Peter Drucker is widely recognized by the global business community. He authored 39 major books, was celebrated by BusinessWeek as ""the man who invented management"" and was featured on the cover of Forbes as ""Still the Youngest Mind,"" among numerous other accolades.

Outlook

Newmont's outlook reflects stable gold production and ongoing investment in its operating assets and most promising growth prospects. Newmont does not include development projects that have not yet been funded or reached execution stage in its outlook which represents upside to guidance.

Attributable gold production is expected to improve to between 4.9 and 5.4 million ounces in 2018, compared to previous 2018 guidance mainly driven by Full Potential mine plan, throughput and recovery improvements. Production is expected to be between 4.9 and 5.4 million ounces in 2019 and longer term production is expected to remain stable at between 4.6 and 5.1 million ounces per year through 2022 excluding development projects which have yet to be approved. 


   -- North America production is expected to be between 2.0 and 2.2 million 
      ounces in 2018 with production from Northwest Exodus, Twin Underground 
      and the Silverstar pit offsetting higher stripping at Carlin and Twin 
      Creeks and lower grade ore at CC&V. Production declines slightly in 2019 
      to between 1.8 and 2.0 million ounces due to planned stripping at Carlin 
      and then increases to between 1.9 and 2.1 million ounces in 2020 due to 
      higher grades at Twin Creeks, CC&V and Long Canyon. The Company continues 
      to pursue profitable growth opportunities at Carlin and Long Canyon. 
 
   -- South America production is expected to be between 615,000 and 675,000 
      ounces in 2018 as Merian delivers mine and mill productivity improvements 
      that partially offset Yanacocha's lower production resulting from lower 
      grades and recoveries from deep transitional ore. Production is expected 
      to be between 590,000 and 690,000 ounces in 2019 with the addition of 
      Quecher Main and between 475,000 and 575,000 ounces per year in 2020 as 
      Yanacocha laybacks are mined out and Merian transitions from saprolite to 
      hard rock. The Company continues to advance near-mine growth 
      opportunities at Merian and both oxide and sulfide potential at 
      Yanacocha. 
 
   -- Australia production is expected to be between 1.5 and 1.7 million ounces 
      in 2018 due to higher grade, recovery and throughput improvements at 
      Tanami and KCGM which offset increased stripping at Boddington. 
      Production is expected to be between 1.4 and 1.6 million ounces in 2019 
      and 2020. In 2020, Boddington completes stripping and accesses higher 
      grade ore which offsets the impact of processing lower grade stockpiles 
      at KCGM. The Company continues to advance studies for a second expansion 
      at Tanami. 
 
   -- Africa production is expected to be between 815,000 and 875,000 ounces in 
      2018 as Full Potential mining improvements at the Subika open pit and a 
      full year of Subika underground production offset the effects of harder, 
      lower grade ore at Akyem. Production is expected to be between 1.1 and 
      1.2 million ounces in 2019 as the Ahafo Mill expansion reaches commercial 
      production and between 880,000 and 980,000 ounces in 2020 as both Ahafo 
      and Akyem reach lower open pit grade. The company continues to advance 
      the Ahafo North project and other prospective surface and underground 
      opportunities. 

Gold cost outlook -- CAS is expected to improve to between $700 and $750 per ounce for 2018 compared to previous 2018 guidance following production increases in North America and Africa and Full Potential cost and efficiency improvements across the portfolio. CAS is expected to be between $620 and $720 per ounce for 2019 and between $650 and $750 per ounce longer term through 2022. AISC is expected to improve to between $965 and $1,025 per ounce in 2018 compared to previous 2018 guidance as improved CAS offsets increases in exploration and advanced projects spend. AISC is expected to be between $870 and $970 per ounce in 2019 and longer-term through 2022. Further Full Potential savings and profitable ounces from projects that are not yet approved represent additional upside not currently captured in guidance. 


   -- North America CAS is expected to improve to between $760 and $810 per 
      ounce compared to previous 2018 guidance with Full Potential efficiency 
      and cost improvements. CAS is expected to be between $680 and $780 per 
      ounce in 2019 and between $655 and $755 per ounce in 2020 on higher 
      production at Twin Creeks, CC&V and Long Canyon. AISC is expected to 
      improve to between $945 and $1,020 per ounce in 2018 on improved unit 
      CAS. AISC is expected to be between $870 and $970 per ounce in 2019 and 
      between $825 and $925 in 2020. 
 
   -- South America CAS is expected to rise to between $705 and $765 per ounce 
      compared to previous 2018 guidance due to lower production and increased 
      costs from processing deeper transitional ore at Yanacocha. CAS is 
      expected to improve to between $560 and $660 per ounce in 2019 as Quecher 
      Main reaches commercial production and be between $690 and $790 per ounce 
      in 2020. AISC is expected to rise to between $945 and $1,045 per ounce in 
      2018 on higher unit CAS and increased sustaining capital for additional 
      haul trucks at Merian. AISC is expected to improve to between $810 and 
      $910 per ounce in 2019 on improved unit CAS and be between $970 and 
      $1,070 per ounce in 2020. 
 
   -- Australia CAS is expected to improve slightly to between $675 and $725 
      per ounce compared to previous 2018 guidance with Full Potential mine 
      plan, throughput and recovery improvements. CAS is expected to be between 
      $670 and $770 per ounce in 2019 and 2020. AISC is expected to improve to 
      between $830 and $890 per ounce in 2018 on improved unit CAS. AISC is 
      expected to be between $840 and $940 per ounce in 2019 and 2020. The 
      Company expects to reach a decision on the Tanami Power project by the 
      end of 2017 which could deliver additional cost savings not currently 
      included in guidance. 
 
   -- Africa CAS is expected to improve to between $680 and $730 per ounce

      throughput and recovery improvements. CAS is expected to be between $520 
      and $620 per ounce in 2019 and between $610 and $710 per ounce in 2020. 
      AISC is expected to improve to between $865 and $925 per ounce in 2018 as 
      Subika Underground reaches commercial production. AISC is expected to be 
      between $700 and $800 per ounce in 2019 as the Ahafo Mill expansion 
      reaches commercial production and between $775 and $875 per ounce in 
      2020. 

Copper -- Attributable production is expected to remain between 40,000 and 60,000 tonnes in 2018 and 2019, increasing to between 45,000 and 65,000 tonnes longer term through 2022 as Phoenix moves into higher copper zones. CAS is expected to rise to between $1.65 and $1.85 per pound in 2018 compared to previous 2018 guidance due to lower grades at Boddington and increasing costs at Phoenix as the mine plan focuses on gold producing zones. CAS is expected to be between $1.80 and $2.20 per pound in 2019 before falling to between $1.40 and $1.80 per pound longer term as Phoenix moves into higher copper zones. AISC is expected to rise to between $2.00 and $2.20 per pound in 2018 on increased unit CAS. AISC is expected to be between $2.25 and $2.55 per pound in 2019 and between $1.80 and $2.10 per pound longer term.

Capital -- Total capital is expected to remain at between $900 and $1,000 million for 2018 and increase in 2019 to between $730 and $830 million compared to previous guidance with the addition of Quecher Main offset by sustaining capital savings across the portfolio. Primary development capital includes expenditure on the Ahafo Mill and Subika Underground expansions in Africa, Twin Underground in North America and Quecher Main in South America. Sustaining capital is expected to be between $600 and $700 million in 2018, between $600 and $700 million for 2019 and between $550 and $650 million per year longer term to cover infrastructure, equipment and ongoing mine development.

Consolidated expense outlook -- Interest expense for 2018 is expected to decrease to between $175 and $215 million due to lower debt balances while investment in exploration and advanced projects is expected to increase to between $350 and $400 million. 2018 outlook for general & administrative costs remains unchanged at between $215 and $240 million and guidance for depreciation and amortization remains unchanged at between $1,225 and $1,325 million.

Assumptions and sensitivities -- Newmont's outlook assumes $1,200 per ounce gold price, $2.50 per pound copper price, $0.75 USD/AUD exchange rate and $55 per barrel WTI oil price. A $100 per ounce increase in gold price would deliver an expected $335 million improvement in attributable free cash flow. Similarly, a $10 per barrel reduction in the price of oil and a $0.05 favorable change in the Australian dollar would deliver an expected $25 million and $45 million improvement in attributable free cash flow, respectively. These estimates exclude current hedge programs; please refer to Newmont's Form 10-Q which was filed with the SEC on October 26, 2017 for further information on hedging positions.

Projects update 


   -- Subika Underground (Africa) leverages existing infrastructure and an 
      optimized approach to develop Ahafo's most promising underground 
      resource. First production was achieved in June 2017 with commercial 
      production expected in the second half of 2018. The project is expected 
      to increase average annual gold production by between 150,000 and 200,000 
      ounces per year for the first five years beginning in 2019 with an 
      initial mine life of approximately 11 years. Capital costs for the 
      project are estimated at between $160 and $200 million with expenditure 
      of between $80 and $90 million in 2018. The project has an IRR of more 
      than 20 percent at a $1,200 gold price. 
 
   -- Ahafo Mill Expansion (Africa) is designed to maximize resource value by 
      improving production margins and accelerating stockpile processing. The 
      project also supports profitable development of Ahafo's highly 
      prospective underground resource. First production is expected in the 
      first half of 2019 with commercial production expected in the second half 
      of 2019. The expansion is expected to increase average annual gold 
      production by between 75,000 and 100,000 ounces per year for the first 
      five years beginning in 2020. Capital costs for the project are estimated 
      at between $140 and $180 million with expenditure of approximately $75 to 
      $85 million in 2018. The project has an IRR of more than 20 percent at a 
      $1,200 gold price.Together the Ahafo expansion projects (Ahafo Mill 
      Expansion and Subika Underground) improve Ahafo's production to between 
      550,000 and 650,000 ounces per year for the first five full years of 
      production (2020--2024). During this period Ahafo's CAS is expected to be 
      between $650 and $750 per ounce and All-in sustaining cost is expected to 
      be between $800 and $900 per ounce. This represents average production 
      improvement of between 200,000 and 300,000 ounces at CAS improvement of 
      between $150 and $250 per ounce and AISC improvement of $250 to $350 per 
      ounce, compared to 2016 actuals. 
 
   -- Twin Underground (North America) is a portal mine beneath Twin Creek's 
      Vista surface mine with similar mineralization. First production was 
      achieved in August 2017 with commercial production expected mid-2018. The 
      expansion is expected to average between 30,000 and 40,000 ounces per 
      year for the first five years (2018 to 2022). During this period CAS is 
      expected to be between $525 and $625 per ounce and AISC between $650 and 
      $750 per ounce. Capital costs are expected to be between $45 and $55 
      million with expenditure of $15 to $25 million in 2018. The project IRR 
      is expected to be about 20 percent at a $1,200 gold price. 
 
   -- Quecher Main (South America) will add oxide production at Yanacocha, 
      leverage existing infrastructure and enable potential future growth at 
      Yanacocha. First production is expected in early 2019 with commercial 
      production in the fourth quarter of 2019. Quecher Main extends the life 
      of the Yanacocha operation to 2027 with average annual gold production of 
      approximately 200,000 ounces per year between 2020 and 2025 (100 percent 
      basis). During the same period incremental CAS is expected to be between 
      $750 and $850 per ounce and AISC between $900 and $1,000 per ounce. 
      Capital costs for the project are expected to be between $250 and $300 
      million with expenditure of $80 to $90 million in 2018. The project IRR 
      is expected to be greater than 10 percent at a $1,200 gold price.

(a)    2018 Outlook in the table above are considered ""forward-looking 
       statements"" and are based upon certain assumptions, including, but not 
       limited to, metal prices, oil prices, certain exchange rates and other 
       assumptions. For example, 2018 Outlook assumes $1,200/oz Au, $2.50/lb 
       Cu, $0.75 USD/AUD exchange rate and $55/barrel WTI; AISC and CAS 
       estimates do not include inflation, for the remainder of the year. 
       Production, CAS, AISC and capital estimates exclude projects that have 
       not yet been approved. The potential impact on inventory valuation as a 
       result of lower prices, input costs, and project decisions are not 
       included as part of this Outlook. Such assumptions may prove to be 
       incorrect and actual results may differ materially from those 
       anticipated. See cautionary note at the end of the release. 
(b)    All-in sustaining costs or AISC as used in the Company's Outlook is a 
       non-GAAP metric defined as the sum of costs applicable to sales 
       (including all direct and indirect costs related to current production 
       incurred to execute on the current mine plan), reclamation costs 
       (including operating accretion and amortization of asset retirement 
       costs), G&A, exploration expense, advanced projects and R&D, treatment 
       and refining costs, other expense, net of one-time adjustments and 
       sustaining capital. See reconciliation at the end of this release. 
(c)    Includes Lone Tree operations. 
(d)    Includes TRJV operations. 
(e)    Consolidated production for Yanacocha and Merian is presented on a 
       total production basis for the mine site; attributable production 
       represents a 51.35% interest for Yanacocha and a 75% interest for 
       Merian. 
(f)    Both consolidated and attributable production are shown on a pro-rata 
       basis with a 50% ownership for Kalgoorlie. 
(g)    Production outlook does not include equity production from stakes in 
       TMAC (28.8%) or La Zanja (46.94%). 
(h)    Consolidated expense outlook is adjusted to exclude extraordinary 
       items. For example, the tax rate outlook above is a consolidated 
       adjusted rate, which assumes the exclusion of certain tax valuation 
       allowance adjustments. 
 
 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, we present the Non-GAAP financial measures of our continuing operations in the tables below.

Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound

Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales of gold and copper by gold ounces or copper pounds sold, respectively. These measures are calculated for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.

All-In Sustaining Costs

Newmont has worked to develop a metric that expands on GAAP measures, such as cost of goods sold, and non-GAAP measures, such as Costs applicable to sales per ounce, to provide visibility into the economics of our mining operations related to expenditures, operating performance and the ability to generate cash flow from our continuing operations.

Current GAAP-measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain production. Therefore, we believe that all-in sustaining costs is a non-GAAP measure that provides additional information to management, investors and analysts that aid in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and in the investor's visibility by better defining the total costs associated with production.

All-in sustaining cost (""AISC"") amounts are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks such as in International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS""), or by reflecting the benefit from selling non-gold metals as a reduction to AISC. Differences may also arise related to definitional differences of sustaining versus development capital activities based upon each company's internal policies.

The following disclosure provides information regarding the adjustments made in determining the all-in sustaining costs measure:

Costs applicable to sales. Includes all direct and indirect costs related to current production incurred to execute the current mine plan. We exclude certain exceptional or unusual amounts from Costs applicable to sales (""CAS""), such as significant revisions to recovery amounts. CAS includes by-product credits from certain metals obtained during the process of extracting and processing the primary ore-body. CAS is accounted for on an accrual basis and excludes Depreciation and amortization and Reclamation and remediation, which is consistent with our presentation of CAS on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In determining AISC, only the CAS associated with producing and selling an ounce of gold is included in the measure. Therefore, the amount of gold CAS included in AISC is derived from the CAS presented in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations less the amount of CAS attributable to the production of copper at our Phoenix and Boddington mines. The copper CAS at those mine sites is disclosed in Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines is based upon the relative sales value of gold and copper produced during the period.

Reclamation costs. Includes accretion expense related to Asset Retirement Obligation (""ARO"") and the amortization of the related Asset Retirement Cost (""ARC"") for the Company's operating properties. Accretion related to the ARO and the amortization of the ARC assets for reclamation does not reflect annual cash outflows but are calculated in accordance with GAAP. The accretion and amortization reflect the periodic costs of reclamation associated with current production and are therefore included in the measure. The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines.

Advanced projects, research and development and exploration. Includes incurred expenses related to projects that are designed to increase or enhance current production and exploration. We note that as current resources are depleted, exploration and advanced projects are necessary for us to replace the depleting reserves or enhance the recovery and processing of the current reserves. As this relates to sustaining our production, and is considered a continuing cost of a mining company, these costs are included in the AISC measure. These costs are derived from the Advanced projects, research and development and Exploration amounts presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations less the amount attributable to the production of copper at our Phoenix and Boddington mines. The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines.

General and administrative. Includes costs related to administrative tasks not directly related to current production, but rather related to support our corporate structure and fulfill our obligations to operate as a public company. Including these expenses in the AISC metric provides visibility of the impact that general and administrative activities have on current operations and profitability on a per ounce basis.

Other expense, net. We exclude certain exceptional or unusual expenses from Other expense, net, such as restructuring, as these are not indicative to sustaining our current operations. Furthermore, this adjustment to Other expense, net is also consistent with the nature of the adjustments made to Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders as disclosed in the Company's non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted net income (loss). The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines.

Treatment and refining costs. Includes costs paid to smelters for treatment and refining of our concentrates to produce the salable metal. These costs are presented net as a reduction of Sales on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Sustaining capital. We determined sustaining capital as those capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. Capital expenditures to develop new operations, or related to projects at existing operations where these projects will enhance production or reserves, are generally considered development. We determined the classification of sustaining and development capital projects based on a systematic review of our project portfolio in light of the nature of each project. Sustaining capital costs are relevant to the AISC metric as these are needed to maintain the Company's current operations and provide improved transparency related to our ability to finance these expenditures from current operations. The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines.

AISC outlook is also a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of the 2018 Gold AISC outlook range to the 2018 CAS outlook range is provided below. The estimates in the table below are considered ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws.

2017-12-30,CMCSA,"Goldman Takes Big Charge on Tax Plan --- Bank faces a one-time $5 billion earnings hit, but long-term benefits from law are expected","Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said Friday it would take a $5 billion earnings charge related to the recent tax overhaul, a one-time jolt expected to be followed by a longer-term windfall from lower rates.

Companies from Wall Street to the heartland are wrestling with the immediate implications of the most sweeping changes to the nation's tax code in three decades. Goldman's announcement, which sets up its first quarterly loss in six years, also hints of broader turbulence coming to U.S. corporate earnings in the new year.","Under one estimate, companies in the S&P 500 index could be forced to take tax-related earnings charges of $235 billion -- about 1% of their combined market value.

The charge will swing Goldman to a quarterly loss and wipe out much of its full-year profit. But the firm, like its brethren on Wall Street and across much of corporate America, will be a winner in the long run as it enjoys the lowest U.S. corporate tax rate in eight decades and gets new flexibility in how it funds itself, invests in the business and returns capital to shareholders.

""They will make this back and then some,"" said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities. ""Tax reform is a positive for Goldman Sachs.""

Goldman shares fell less than 1%. Analysts had expected the firm to take a tax-related earnings hit of between $3 billion and $6 billion.

About two-thirds of the impact, or $3 billion, is related to a newly enacted, one-time tax on U.S. companies' overseas earnings.

Goldman had $31 billion parked offshore at the end of 2016, much of it in cash that will now be subject to a one-time tax of 15%.

Zion Research Group estimates that S&P 500 companies will book quarterly hits of $235 billion in the coming weeks on the $2.8 trillion they have amassed in foreign operations.

Drugmakers and technology firms, whose mazes of global intellectual-property arrangements rely heavily on subsidiaries in low-tax countries, account for 69% of the total.

Just five companies -- Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Pfizer Inc., Oracle Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. -- account for one-third, according to Zion's estimates.

Most large tech companies will take ""a big hit"" to their coming earnings, said Edward Kleinbard, a tax professor at the University of Southern California law school.

One exception, he said, is Apple, which has already recorded tax charges for a large portion of its overseas earnings.

Drugmaker Amgen Inc., which has nearly $40 billion parked abroad, said last week that it expects to incur a tax expense of at least $6 billion because of the new law.

Firms in these sectors may see their long-term tax rates rise, too. But they will gain flexibility: Many high-technology companies have twisted themselves into fiscal knots to avoid paying taxes on overseas cash, including loading up on debt at home and putting off domestic investments.

Some companies are sharing the bounty with employees. AT&T Inc., Comcast Corp. and Bank of America Corp. are granting one-time bonuses of $1,000.

Booking those expenses before year-end would let the companies deduct the costs under their old, higher rates, saving millions.

In a similar move, Goldman will deliver some stock compensation owed to top executives a few weeks early in order to generate tax savings for the firm, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The bank expects to save $140 million by delivering stock to about 300 employees in high-tax states like New York and California, the person said.

Ordinarily those shares, which were earned in prior years, would be delivered next month.

Shareholders are likely to benefit, too.

By removing incentives to park cash overseas, the new tax law frees up billions of dollars that could go toward buybacks and dividends for investors.

One study found that in 2004, when American companies got a chance to bring foreign cash home at lower tax rates, 94 cents of every repatriated dollar was returned to shareholders.

""It's a major windfall of cash,"" said Alethia Young, a Credit Suisse Group AG biotech analyst.

Meanwhile, Goldman will also write down the value of deferred tax assets, which are past losses and other items that can be used to defray future tax bills. Goldman has about $5 billion of these credits, which are less valuable going forward because the corporate tax rate will be lower.

Deferred-tax assets aren't unique to banks, but Wall Street firms racked up huge losses during the financial crisis and so tend to have a lot of them.

Citigroup Inc. has said it would take a $20 billion earnings charge from writing down its $46 billion of deferred-tax assets as well as for taxes assessed on its overseas profits.

Bank of America expects to take a $3 billion hit on its $19 billion stash, while Credit Suisse and Barclays PLC have announced smaller charges in recent days.

In the long run, though, Wall Street firms will be among the biggest beneficiaries of the new tax system. The law, signed last week by President Donald Trump, reduces the headline corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, its lowest level since 1939.

Banks are relatively high taxpayers because they get fewer of the breaks, such as for research and development, that are available to technology or pharmaceutical companies. So they benefit more from the rate reduction.

Goldman has averaged a 30% tax rate over the past three years, and JMP's Mr. Ryan estimates an earnings benefit of 5% to 10% a year going forward. Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman said in June that a 25% corporate tax rate -- higher than it ultimately landed -- would lift his bank's earnings by 15% a year.

Press Release: Fitch Rates AmerisourceBergen's Senior Notes 'A-'; Outlook Stable


 
 
The following is a press release from Fitch Ratings : 
 ","Fitch Ratings-New York-05 December 2017: Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to AmerisourceBergen 's (ABC) sale of $750 million senior notes due 2027 and $500 million senior notes due 2047. Proceeds are expected to be used to finance the acquisition of H.D. Smith for $815 million in cash and to redeem 4.875% senior notes due Nov. 15, 2019, and for general corporate purposes. See key terms of the notes below the list of rating actions.

Fitch has affirmed ABC's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A-'. The Outlook is Stable.

Fitch also affirmed ABC's Short-Term IDR at 'F2'.

A full list of ratings follows at the end of the release. The ratings apply to approximately pro forma $4.3 billion of debt at Sept. 30, 2017. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Stable Operations, Low Margins: ABC's credit profile benefits from a stable operating profile and consistent cash generation. Strong ratings are supported by steady pharmaceutical demand, an oligopolistic drug distribution industry in the U.S. and relative insulation from most drug pricing and regulatory pressures, despite very low margins. ABC's long-term relationship with Walgreens provides an added element of meaningful stability and growth.

Solid Liquidity, Cash Generation: ABC maintains a solid liquidity position, supported by strong cash flows and strong access to capital markets. Fitch expects annual FFO and FCF to exceed $2 billion and $1 billion, respectively, but notes that FCF can be affected by large working capital swings inherent to large healthcare distributors.

Narrow Focus, Business Concentration: ABC's business is narrowly focused on the distribution of pharmaceutical products and related services. Furthermore, about 45% of sales are to the firm's two largest customers: Walgreens Boots Alliance Corp . (BBB/Stable) and Express Scripts Holding Corp . (BBB/Stable).

Close Alignment with Walgreens : Fitch views Walgreens as a strong long-term partner for ABC, particularly as the firm is expected to drive industry-leading organic growth and bring additional distribution volumes to ABC through its announced transactions with Rite Aid Corp . (B/Stable ) and Prime Therapeutics . Fitch expects the proportion of revenues ABC sources from Walgreens will trend higher over the near term.

Low U.S. Growth, Event Risk: Fitch believes there are low growth opportunities in the traditional U.S. drug distribution space. Growth opportunities are more robust for the company's global commercialization and animal health businesses, but represent a relatively small portion of ABC as a whole. As a result, and now more so considering ABC's alignment with Walgreens , Fitch expects ABC to pursue both organic and inorganic growth in service-related and non-U.S. markets over the intermediate to longer term.

DERIVATION SUMMARY

ABC's 'A-' Long-term Issuer Default Rating reflects its solid position as one of the largest global pharmaceutical distributors, stable operating profile and consistent cash generation. Fitch believes that AmerisourceBergen will maintain a commitment to maintaining gross leverage at or below 1.4x over the near term and FCF/debt at or above 20%, except for the year following debt-funded acquisitions. The credit profiles of ABC and its peers, Cardinal Health (BBB+/Negative) and McKesson Corp . (BBB+/Stable) benefit from secular trends such as an aging U.S. population and increased use of generic prescription drugs and drug therapies; however, drug distributors face headwinds in the form of declining generic drug prices and slower brand drug inflation over the medium term. ABC has some customer concentration risk; its top two customers, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Express Scripts , accounted for 30% and 15% of revenues, respectively for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch's Ratings Case forecast incorporates the following assumptions:

-- Top-line growth of approximately 8% in 2017 and 7% in 2018. The year 2018 benefits from growth at Walgreens and the addition of new volumes in connection with the JV between Walgreens and Prime Therapeutics . Fitch assumes the addition of new business from legacy Rite Aid stores beginning in fiscal 2018, less the impact of store divestitures. Fiscal 2018 also includes the renewal of Express Scripts contract, with no material change in terms. Some growth could shift to 2017 from 2018 depending on the timing and pacing of ABC providing service to legacy Rite Aid stores.

-- Declining to flat EBITDA margins for the forecast period. Margins are pressured in 2018-2019 from repricing associated with renewed contracts with Kaiser Permanente and Compliant Pharmacy Alliance Cooperative (CPA), from lower branded-price inflation expectations, continued generic price deflation, and from a growing proportion of sales to Walgreens , albeit at lower margins. Growth at MWI, PharMEDium and in specialty, as well as improving generic purchasing scale through the addition of Rite Aid and Prime Therapeutics volumes offset these pressures somewhat.

-- FCF of approximately $1 billion-$1.5 billion in both 2018 and 2019. Margin pressures contribute to FFO that grows more slowly than the top line. Capex declines in 2018 ($325 million) and the impact of certain working capital concessions related to a large customer and increase in merchandise inventories reduce FCF.

-- Gross debt/EBITDA increasing to 1.7x in 2018 following the recent acquisition and senior notes offering, but stepping down to 1.4x at fiscal year end 2019 with amortization of debt and modest EBITDA growth. Discretionary FCF is more than sufficient to repay debt over the next three fiscal years. Fitch assumes ABC will refinance debt maturities through 2021. Remaining capital is expected to be used for bolt-on M&A, common stock dividends and share repurchase activity.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action

ABC currently has limited flexibility at its current ratings. Maintenance of the 'A-' long-term rating considers gross debt/EBITDA of 1.4x by year-end 2019 and maintenance of FCF/to debt above 25%. Gross debt/EBITDA is expected to trend above 1.4x in 2018 following the acquisition of H.D. Smith , but consistent FCF applied to debt reduction in 2019-2021 is expected to bring leverage at or below Fitch's expectations.

Fitch notes that ABC's leverage has moved higher over the past two years because of acquisitions and several large charges to operating income (lawsuits, warrant expense). However, ABC is expected to maintain a commitment to operating with low debt leverage and responsible allocation of capital, with strong cash generation.

An upgrade to 'A' is not expected over the ratings horizon. Fitch believes ABC's management would need to commit to operating with gross debt leverage below 0.8x, accompanied by increased profit margins and to maintain FCF/ debt at or above 25%. Fitch does not expect ABC to commit to operating with such low leverage or to enhance profit margins in the near to intermediate term.

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action

A downgrade to 'BBB+' would likely be the result of a change in the firm's current capital deployment strategy, resulting in gross debt/EBITDA sustainably above 1.4x and FCF/debt durably below 20%. Negative rating actions are not expected to directly result from recent shifts in the industry's competitive and pricing dynamics, namely lower branded price inflation and key contract renewals, but may lead to erosion of the aforementioned metrics over the medium term. However, ABC's 'A-' IDR could be pressured by a significant leveraged acquisition, customer losses, heightened competition or a combination of all of these factors.

LIQUIDITY

ABC has access to a large amount of internal liquidity, in addition to solid access to the capital markets. Contractual debt maturities are manageable and well-laddered. FCF is expected to range from $1 billion to $1.5 billion in 2018 and 2019, which adequately covers debt maturities over the same period. Fitch expects that ABC will continue to maintain approximately $1 billion of cash available during the forecast period. As of Sept. 30, 2017 and 2016, ABC's cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were $995.7 million and $582.9 million, respectively, and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. ABC has disclosed that it expects its cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries will grow. Amounts held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support non-U.S. liquidity needs, including future acquisitions of non-U.S. entities, although a portion may from time to time be subject to short-term intercompany loans to U.S. subsidiaries. Fitch does not expect ABC to repatriate cash in foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. in the near term.

FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS

Fitch has assigned the following rating:

AmerisourceBergen Corporation

--Long-term senior unsecured note 'A-'.

Fitch affirms AmerisourceBergen Corporation as follows:

--Long-Term IDR at 'A-'

--Short-Term IDR at 'F2'

--Commercial Paper at 'F2'

--Senior unsecured bank facility at 'A-'

--Long-term senior unsecured notes at 'A-'

The Rating Outlook is Stable.

The 2027 and 2047 notes are unsecured and will rank equal in right of payment with all of ABC's other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, and senior to any of its future indebtedness, if any, that expressly provides for its subordination to the notes.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of FitchÃ¢ tms factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of FitchÃ¢ tms ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

The information in this report is provided Ã¢ oeas isÃ¢ without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

1220 ET - Total wins a contract to fuel CMA CGM 's new container ships with natural gas over the next 10 years and looks to charter an LNG bunker vessel for the job as it expects more operators to switch to natural from heavy-bunker fuel. Deploying LNG refueling ships is one way to address concerns of limited availability in many ports across the world. For CMA CGM alone, which broke ground by choosing natural gas as the fuel choice for nine 22,000-box behemoths, Total will supply 300,000 tons of LNG a year. The value of the contract isn't known.

1219 ET - CEOs are expressing increasing optimism in capital spending while indicating less enthusiasm toward hiring, meaning companies could increasingly invest in capital instead of labor if tax reform comes to fruition. CEO plans for capital investment rose to the highest level since 2Q 2011, according to the Business Roundtable's 4Q survey. Meanwhile, hiring plans were less robust than in 3Q. The share of firms planning to reduce staff over the next six months rose slightly, while the share planning to increase hiring held steady. Jamie Dimon , chairman of the Business Roundtable and JPMorgan CEO, said business confidence is contingent on tax reform. ""To continue this momentum, it is critical that we enact pro-growth tax reform that will level the playing field for US business to be globally competitive,"" he said. (sarah.chaney@wsj.com)

1214 ET - Microsoft will expand its Mountain View, Calif., campus by 643,000 square feet, about 35%, as part of a multibillion-dollar effort companywide to modernize and expand its office buildings. A week ago, the Redmond, Wash., software company announced plans to expand its headquarters, creating 2.5 million square feet of new office space, enough for at least 8,000 more employees. The company expects the workers to move into the new facilities on its 32-acre site in Mountain View in December 2019. Microsoft currently employs 2,000 workers in the Bay Area. The company doesn't plan to consolidate its other Bay Area facilities, in San Francisco, Palo Alto and Sunnyvale. Some of those properties were picked up through acquisitions of such companies as LinkedIn and Yammer. (jay.greene@wsj.com; @greene)

1206 ET - American Express CEO Kenneth Chenault says at an investor conference Tuesday that the number of people who signed up for the company's premium Platinum card since March increased more than 65% from a year ago. The company raised annual fees for the card in March to $550 from $450, leading to concerns among investors that new sign-ups and retention for the card would slip. Chenault says that existing Platinum cardholder retention levels ""remain stable"" since September, when the higher fee kicked in for those cardholders. (annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com)

1151 ET - Shares of DeVry University parent Adtalem Global Education surge 9% on news that it will sell DeVry and its Keller business school to Cogswell Education, a tiny college operator in California. Adtalem Global, which also runs the Ross medical school and Becker-branded training for professional certifications, says it will be able to focus more on those verticals now. Indicating just how much Adtalem Global wanted DeVry off its books, Adtalem gets nothing up-front on the deal--and in fact committed to transferring the school with a working capital balance of $7.5M-$20.1M, based on enrollment numbers. Adtalem Global could earn up to $20M over the next 10 years, depending on DeVry 's free cash flow. (melissa.korn@wsj.com; @melissakorn)

1149 ET - Kroger CFO Mike Schlotman says late deliveries from suppliers ""clearly has been a problem for us,"" and the US's largest supermarket chain had more late trucks than he thought. ""The window is wide. It baffles me why any sophisticated or semi-sophisticated supplier can't get a truck to us in two days,"" Schlotman says at a Barclays investor conference.

1145 ET - Kroger says the tax bill being reconciled in Congress would benefit it across the board, but a provision that could limit the deductibility of corporate debt would hurt competitors that are highly-levered.

1145 ET - Tightening oil inventories among OECD nations and continued strong demand sounds like a win-win for energy stocks, but Tudor Pickering says ""traction remains elusive,"" as investors demand more returns and less growth. ""Growth has become tantamount to the proverbial four-letter word in some circles,"" it says, noting industry executives and investors are in a ""tenuous dance"" on issues such as free cash flow yields and full-cycle returns, which not only include drilling and operating costs but also land and major infrastructure -- things oil companies sometimes fail to mention in presentations. The companies striking the correct growth/returns balance will be those with ""quality assets in preferred basins, scale, balance sheets with dry powder [and] proven execution,"" firms that Tudor says include Chevron and Anadarko.

Press Release: S&PGR Revises CenterPoint Energy And Subs Outlk To Stable","
 
 
The following is a press release from Standard & Poor's : 
 
     -- CenterPoint Energy Inc . announced it was abandoning efforts to sell 
its full interest in Enable Midstream Partners L.P . in the very near-term. 
     -- We are affirming our ratings, including the 'A-' issuer credit 
ratings, on CenterPoint and its subsidiaries, CenterPoint Energy Houston 
Electric LLC  and CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp . At the same time, we are 
revising the outlook on each entity to stable from positive. 
     -- The stable outlook reflects our revised base case that CenterPoint 
will either maintain its interest or gradually reduce its limited partnership 
interest in higher-volatility Enable, supporting our assessment of 
CenterPoint's business risk profile at the lower half of the range for its 
business risk profile category. 
 
NEW YORK (S&P Global Ratings) Dec. 4, 2017-- S&P Global Ratings today revised 
its rating outlook on Houston-based CenterPoint Energy Inc . and subsidiaries 
CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric LLC  (CEHE) and CenterPoint Energy 
Resources Corp . (CERC) to stable from positive. At the same time, we affirmed 
our ratings, including the 'A-' issuer credit ratings, on CenterPoint and its 
subsidiaries. 
 
The stable outlook incorporates CenterPoint Energy Inc .'s continued ownership 
interest in Enable Midstream Partners L.P . and our expectations that 
CenterPoint will either maintain its stake or gradually sell its interest in 
higher-volatility Enable, supporting our current assessment of CenterPoint's 
business risk profile. 
 
The stable outlook reflects our revised base case that CenterPoint will either 
maintain its interest or gradually sell its interest in higher-volatility 
Enable. We expect that CenterPoint's business risk profile will remain the 
same, reflecting the lower-risk utility business offset by the higher-risk 
Enable. We expect that the financial measures will more consistently reflect 
the higher half of the range for its financial risk profile category. 
Specifically, we expect FFO to debt of about 20%. 
 
We could lower the rating in the next 12 to 24 months if higher-risk Enable 
disproportionally grows or CenterPoint maintains its current business risk 
composition but financial measure weakens to the lower end of the range for 
its financial risk profile category. This could occur if consolidated FFO to 
debt consistently weakened to below 16%. 
 
We could raise the rating over the next 12 to 24 months if CenterPoint's 
business risk profile improved due to the sale of Enable and the company 
maintains financial measures consistent with the higher end of the range for 
its financial risk profile category. This would include FFO to debt 
consistently greater than 20%.

Press Release: S&PGR Rates American Tower's Senior Unsecured Notes 'BBB-'","
 
 
The following is a press release from Standard & Poor's : 
 
NEW YORK (S&P Global Ratings) Dec. 5, 2017-S&P Global Ratings today assigned 
its 'BBB-' issue-level rating to Boston-based wireless tower operator American 
Tower Corp.'s proposed senior unsecured notes due 2023 and 2028 (amount and 
allocations to be determined). The company will use the net proceeds to repay 
borrowings under the 2013 and 2014 revolving credit facilities, which had 
approximately $2.4 billion and $1.7 billion outstanding, respectively, as of 
Sept. 30, 2017, and for general corporate purposes. 
 
Our 'BBB-' corporate credit rating and stable rating outlook on American Tower 
are unchanged. We do not expect the transaction to affect the company's key 
credit measures, including adjusted leverage, which was about 5.5x as of Sept. 
30, 2017. While we expect modest improvement in leverage in 2018 from EBITDA 
growth driven by amendments, increased tenancy, and rent escalations, we 
believe that ongoing acquisition and share repurchase activity will keep 
leverage elevated over the next couple of years.

2017-12-20,IT,BlackBerry Goes Driving --- Former phone giant pins growth prospects on software for autonomous vehicles,"KANATA, Ontario -- BlackBerry Ltd. is betting its future on a business that makes software for next-generation driverless cars.

Having abandoned production of its once-ubiquitous smartphones, the Canadian company recently refocused its mission around QNX, a core unit whose technology provides a foundation for car-entertainment and information systems. BlackBerry aims to double its QNX engineering staff to about 1,000 in the coming years and spend $76 million to create a center for self-driving car technology near Ottawa.","BlackBerry is entering a highly competitive field, with some of the world's biggest tech companies investing in autonomous-vehicle research. Still, the company's QNX push has yielded some early results, including tie-ups with Ford Motor Co. and Aptiv PLC, the General Motors Co. spinoff formerly known as Delphi Automotive PLC.

A possible deal with Tata Motors Ltd.'s Jaguar Land Rover unit is in the works.

In September, the company began a marketing campaign with billboards in Silicon Valley and Detroit showing a car and the tag line ""Is Your Car BlackBerry Secure?"" with the aim of promoting its technology as a way to protect autonomous vehicles from hacking.

Over the long term, ""the auto sector is our best chance at revenue growth,"" BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen said in an interview. Mr. Chen will deliver a keynote address next month at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.

The company has struggled to find its footing in recent years after losing out to phones made by Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. BlackBerry once counted 80 million phone subscribers using its email service, according to the company.

Its customer base evaporated after employers began allowing workers to use personal devices, and its market capitalization plunged from a peak of 79.5 billion Canadian dollars ($61.7 billion) in 2008 to C$3.24 billion in late 2013.

BlackBerry sells phones sourced from third-party manufacturers after it stopped making them last year; but the number is so small that research firm Gartner Inc. measured BlackBerry's share of the global device market at 0.0%. The company's other main business, software management for phones, currently provides the bulk of its revenue, though analysts say it is appearing to plateau.

In 2010, BlackBerry bought QNX from Harman International Industries Inc. -- which was acquired earlier this year by Samsung -- to help bolster the operating system for its BB10 devices. The aim was to include enough features to draw interest away from iPhones and Android-supported phones, but the new BlackBerry devices failed to catch on and the company shifted its engineering resources back to its QNX division as car makers started developing software.

A successful turnaround pinned to QNX could make BlackBerry attractive to a potential buyer, said Todd Coupland, a technology analyst with CIBC World Markets, adding that ""it will first need to announce more self-driving wins to legitimize its position in the market.""

One possible sign that investors are taking note of the software initiatives: BlackBerry's shares are trading just under $11, up about half on the year.

If the stock continues to rise, BlackBerry's two biggest shareholders -- Pasadena, Calif.-based Primecap Management Corp. and Toronto-based Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. -- could support a potential sale that would allow them to recoup an investment that has long performed poorly, people familiar with the matter said. The two shareholders combined own about one-quarter of the company's shares.

In recent years, BlackBerry's large library of mobile, encryption and QNX patents has drawn interest, the people said. However, they added that Mr. Chen has rebuffed several takeover feelers as inadequate and BlackBerry's major shareholders have backed him.

Tyson, whose grandfather founded the company, has previously topped a list of Fortune 100 company officials for compensation for personal jet travel, and in 2016 he received $1.29M in such compensation. The Tyson family owns nearly all ""supervoting"" shares, giving the family majority voting power among shareholders. A Tyson spokeswoman says that Tyson's employment contract specifically permits his personal use of company-owned aircraft. Tyson's shares are up 32% this year, thanks to favorable profit margins in its core chicken business and growth in its prepared foods products, versus a 19.8% gain in the S&P 500.

The chain, whose sales and stock price have been battered by food safety issues over the last two years, said the reports have not been validated and that it has not been contacted by any customers directly and is not aware of any reports having been made to the local health department. Five reports have been posted on iwaspoisoned.com representing seven people who claimed to have gotten sick after eating different dishes at the same Los Angeles location.

1404 ET - The persistent threat of a sanctions snapback from the Trump administration coupled with a more confrontational approach are putting Iran's oil prospects at risk in 2018, says Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets . ""Even if Trump renews the waivers in January, the issue will continuously come up every quarter and serve as something of a Damocles Sword over the nuclear deal,"" she says, potentially curtailing ""foreign investment in the Iranian energy sector and imperil output expansion plans."" A snapback could also ""force foreign refineries to source less crude from Iran, especially if the threat of being locked out of US capital markets were revived,"" Ms Croft says. In addition, ""Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman is also adopting a much more confrontational approach towards Iran, upping the risk of a serious escalation in this regional rivalry next year,"" she adds.

1354 ET - It's a scrap between nonprofits in the food world, as a group backed by US restaurants and food companies takes aim at one of the top animal-welfare advocates. The Center for Consumer Freedom, funded in part by the food industry, filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission against the Humane Society of the US over alleged ""deceptive advertising"" and misrepresenting its spending to donors. The CCF, which has also protested soda taxes and defended genetically engineered crops, says the HSUS is masquerading as a pet shelter operator as it campaigns against the US meat industry; an HSUS spokeswoman calls the complaint the latest in a series of failed efforts to dry up HSUS funding.

The analyst says that after the wave of retirements last year, there are still more than 100 non-retiring coal plants that are operating at dangerously low utilizations below the 31% utilization that officially retiring plants were operating at. ""It's hard to argue that low utilizations are sustainable in the long-term,"" he says, adding in a new report that ""the coal plants most at risk come from areas that are on top of or adjacent to the Marcellus and Utica, where we have seen prolific natural gas production growth over the past few years.""

1334 ET - With a sweeping tax bill now en route to President Trump's desk for signature, one farm group fears spending cuts hurtful to the nation's farmers are next. Plenty of farm groups supported the Republican tax overhaul, passed now by both the House and Senate. But the National Farmers Union , which advocates for small farmers, predicts danger for programs that support farmers and help low-income families buy food. ""This tax bill leaves a $1.5 trillion hole in the budget - a hole that some members of Congress will want to fill with farm program and entitlement spending cuts,"" said Roger Johnson, the group's president, who vowed to fight cuts during a slump in the farm economy.

1313 ET - Most who work in advertising know the US digital-ad market is dominated by two massive players: Facebook and Alphabet's Google . But by how much? Pivotal Research estimated Google and Facebook made 73% of the $20.8B in US digital ad revenue in 2Q, up from 63% two years prior. Pivotal's last estimated the two behemoths controlled 70% of the market in 1Q last year. Google and Facebook accounted for 83% of all growth in 2Q, Pivotal says. Still, digital advertising is growing so rapidly that other players benefited, too. Digital-ad sales for firms that aren't Google and Facebook grew by 15% in 2Q over a year prior, compared with a 7% growth all of 2016. (jack.nicas@wsj.com; @jacknicas)

Analysts expect the company to pay around $2.8B in taxes this year. Its shares touched another record earlier Wednesday, edging closer to the $300 mark and recently up 0.5% at $298.67.

1254 ET - Trailing three-month sales at Emerson's automation solutions unit accelerated to climb 20% through November, which Scott Davis at Melius Research views as ""amazingly bullish"" for broader capital investment among industrial companies.

2017-12-23,NKE,Nike Isn't Quite Doing It -- Heard on the Street,"Delivering Nike's second-quarter results on Thursday, Chief Executive Mark Parker spoke of the sportswear company ""unleashing a relentless flow of innovation at a scale that our industry has never seen."" Such talk may not comfort investors much longer. Shares were down 6% in Friday morning trading.

Though the company reported earnings of 46 cents a share, beating analysts' expectations of 40 cents, net income decreased 9% year over year to $767 million. Gross margins contracted and selling and administrative expense rose. Revenue reached $8.6 billion, an annual increase of 5%.","Over half of Nike's revenue and even more of its growth comes from outside North America. The company says growth from other continents will contribute 75% of incremental growth over the next five years. It is particularly focused on China, its third-largest market after North America and Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Revenue in China grew 16% in the quarter, reaching $1.2 billion. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa it grew 19% to $2.1 billion.

Yet Nike's domestic business remains large, and it has become a large challenge as well. At its investors day in October, the company painted a multiyear trajectory of growth world-wide. It isn't clear, however, that it can fill the gap between where it is and where it says it will be.

""Investors are holding on for a long-term win, but there will come a point when you actually need to see those results,"" says Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst at Nomura Securities.

A company that once seemingly could do no wrong is in a rut. Nike has beaten analysts' consensus expectations in each of its last 10 earnings reports by an average of 16%, but the shares have still fallen meaningfully six of those times.

Nike encourages belief, and investors want to believe. If it doesn't start to deliver, that faith may sour further.

Exelon , the parent company of Pepco, delivers first $250,000 grant to support Congress Heights center for homeless kids and families ","
WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 22, 2017-- 

Exelon has awarded a $250,000 grant to Bright Beginnings, an organization that operates the only early childhood and family development centers dedicated to homeless children in Washington, D.C. The funding will support the construction of three activity centers and playgrounds at Bright Beginnings' new child and family development center in the Congress Heights neighborhood, providing children with safe spaces to play, learn and receive support and care.

The new center, scheduled to open next summer, will expand vital services to help homeless families. Employee volunteers from Pepco and Exelon , the parent company of the Washington, D.C.-based electric utility Pepco, will also help build the playgrounds at the new site.

""Mayor Muriel Bowser has made addressing homelessness a top priority. At Exelon , we are committed to joining District leaders and doing our part to help children get access to the essential resources and facilities needed to succeed and thrive,"" said Maggie FitzPatrick, Exelon's senior vice president of Corporate Affairs, who serves on Bright Beginnings' board of directors. ""Exelon supports organizations that strengthen our communities, and Bright Beginnings is delivering essential services every day for District kids and families. We call on other corporations to join us in bolstering those who are providing a lifeline to kids who urgently need our collective support.""

The American Institutes for Research reports that there are 2.5 million homeless children in America today; the equivalent of one in every 30 children in the United States. With child care costs in D.C. averaging $23,000 per child each year, according to research from Child Care Aware of America , the free services offered by Bright Beginnings help give homeless children and parents hope and a chance at a brighter future.

Founded in 1990, Bright Beginnings has helped more than 3,400 children enter kindergarten ready to learn. Bright Beginnings uses a holistic approach to address the needs of both children and their parents, with services including free child care, early education, family health and wellness support, therapeutic services and workforce development counseling. With the expansion to a second center, Bright Beginnings will equip the community with resources that help homeless families secure and retain employment, complete education and live in safe neighborhoods.

""Our centers and programs serve as pillars to the community, helping to restore and revitalize the quality of life for every homeless child and family in D.C.,"" said Dr. Marla Dean, executive director of Bright Beginnings. ""We appreciate Exelon 's generous contribution toward building playgrounds at our new center, which will help position our children for success as they grow, learn and prepare for their first day of kindergarten.""

Exelon 's community programs are supported by its employees, who participate in volunteer and charitable giving opportunities that positively impact the communities where they work and live. Last year, Exelon companies and the Exelon Foundation collectively donated more than $46.5 million to nonprofits, including more than $4.5 million in contributions from Pepco. This year, Exelon employees dedicated 200,000 hours of community service and pledged more than $12.6 million through Exelon 's Employee Giving Campaign. In 2017, Exelon was also named to Points of Light 's list of the 50 most community-minded companies in the country.

PR Newswire","NEW YORK, Dec. 7, 2017

NEW YORK, Dec. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE: EW), the global leader in patient-focused innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring, will discuss the company's strategy for longer-term growth, provide an update on its technology pipeline and share its financial guidance during its annual investor conference today in New York City.

Highlights of today's conference include: 


   -- Reaffirming October 2017 financial guidance1 
 
   -- Projected 2018 global sales of $3.5 to $3.9 billion, representing 
      underlying2 growth of 9 to 10% 
 
   -- Projected 2018 THVT sales of $2.1 to $2.4 billion, representing 
      underlying growth of 11 to 15% 
 
   -- Estimated 2018 adjusted earnings per share3 of $4.10 to $4.30 
 
   -- Aggressive R&D investments pursuing large opportunities in transcatheter 
      valve therapies expected to drive continued organic growth 

""As we come to the end of 2017, our performance and accomplishments this year significantly exceeded our expectations, and we expect 2018 to be another strong year for Edwards Lifesciences . Our global growth is being driven by our transcatheter aortic valve therapies, and continued advancement in each of our market-leading product lines,"" said Michael A. Mussallem , chairman and CEO. ""In 2018, we are projecting strong financial results while we continue to invest aggressively to provide breakthrough therapies for patients in need. During the year, we expect to achieve a number of meaningful clinical milestones that will serve as indicators of our progress in advancing multiple transcatheter mitral and tricuspid programs.""

Among the topics being discussed at today's conference are: 


   -- Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy -- Edwards continues to believe the 
      global TAVR opportunity will exceed $5 billion by 2021 and continue to 
      grow thereafter, fueled by broader indications for its TAVR therapy, 
      greater therapy awareness and advances in the technology. Edwards is also 
      investing in research and development to produce transformational TAVR 
      technologies to further strengthen its leadership position. The company 
      continues to anticipate launches of its Edwards SAPIEN 3 Ultra system and 
      Edwards CENTERA valve system in 2018. In its clinical trial studying 
      low-risk surgical patients, Edwards expects results to be presented in 
      the first half of 2019 followed by commercial approval in late 2019. 
 
   -- Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies -- Estimated to be a more 
      than $3 billion opportunity by 2025, Edwards will discuss its multiple 
      transcatheter programs aimed at transforming care for the many patients 
      suffering from mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. The company has made 
      significant progress in many of its programs and is expecting to achieve 
      a number of meaningful clinical milestones in 2018. Edwards plans to 
      launch at least one transformational therapy in Europe each year in 2018, 
      2019 and 2020 led by its Cardioband and PASCAL programs. 
 
   -- Surgical Heart Valve Therapy -- Edwards expects growth in its 
      market-leading surgical heart valve portfolio despite the continued 
      strong adoption of TAVR therapy in more developed regions. The company is 
      pursuing a robust pipeline of innovative new products including the 
      Edwards INTUITY Elite valve system, and the Edwards INSPIRIS valve, which 
      is expected to be introduced in the U.S. and Japan in 2018. As announced 
      yesterday, Edwards acquired Harpoon Medical and plans to launch this 
      mitral repair therapy in Europe next year. 
 
   -- Critical Care -- Edwards plans to continue to distinguish its leadership 
      position in Critical Care technologies with the ongoing rollout of its

GOODLETTSVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 07, 2017-- 

Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG) today reported financial results for its fiscal 2017 third quarter (13 weeks) ended November 3, 2017.

""We are pleased with our overall third quarter results, which include a strong same-store sales growth of 4.3% and increases in both average transaction amount and customer traffic over the 2016 third quarter. During the quarter, we effectively balanced our same-store sales growth while achieving gross profit rate expansion and continuing our planned investments in the business.

""We remain excited about the future for Dollar General . For fiscal 2018, we have plans to execute approximately 2,000 real estate projects comprised of 900 new stores, 1,000 store remodels and 100 store relocations. We continue to believe that investing in the business through our high-return new store growth is the best use of our capital to help drive long-term shareholder value. Our new store growth is complemented with a significant increase in our store remodel program from fiscal 2017 that we view as an investment to enhance and consistently deliver on our brand promise to help our customers save time and money every day,"" said Todd Vasos , Dollar General's chief executive officer.

Third Quarter 2017 Highlights

Net sales increased 11.0 percent to $5.90 billion in the 2017 third quarter compared to $5.32 billion in the 2016 third quarter. Same-store sales increased 4.3 percent, attributable to increases in average transaction amount and customer traffic, including an estimated 30 to 35 basis point net benefit from hurricane-related sales. Same-store sales increases were driven by positive results in the consumables, seasonal and apparel categories, partially offset by negative results in the home products category. Same-store sales results in the three non-consumables categories, when aggregated, were positive. The net sales increase was also positively affected by sales from new stores, modestly offset by sales from closed stores.

Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 29.9 percent in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of eight basis points from the 2016 third quarter. The gross profit rate increase was primarily attributable to higher initial inventory markups and an improved rate of inventory shrink. Partially offsetting these items were a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which generally have a lower gross profit rate than other product categories, sales of lower-margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumables sales, and increased transportation costs.

Selling, general and administrative expense (""SG&A"") as a percentage of net sales was 22.9 percent in the 2017 third quarter compared to 22.5 percent in the 2016 third quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. The SG&A increase was primarily attributable to increased retail labor expenses, primarily as a result of the Company's investment in store manager compensation, and increased incentive compensation and occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales. Partially offsetting these increased expenses were lower utilities costs and a reduction in advertising costs. During the 2017 third quarter, the Company recorded incremental expenses of approximately $24.8 million, or 42 basis points, related to the impact of two hurricanes which occurred during the quarter as set forth below under ""Summary of Impact of Hurricanes on 2017 Third Quarter Results."" Similarly, in the 2016 third quarter, the Company incurred incremental charges of $13.0 million, or 25 basis points, associated with the acquisition of former Walmart Express store locations and the related closure of existing stores plus an incremental $7.7 million, or 14 basis points, of expenses primarily related to natural disasters.

The Company's net income was $253 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, in the 2017 third quarter, compared to net income of $235 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, in the 2016 third quarter. An estimated $0.05 hurricane-related net negative impact, driven by hurricane-related expenses, is included in diluted earnings per share for the 2017 third quarter. Similarly, the 2016 third quarter included an approximate $0.05 charge for the Walmart Express store acquisition and disaster-related expenses.

The effective income tax rate was 35.8 percent for the 2017 third quarter compared to a rate of 36.2 percent for the 2016 third quarter. The effective income tax rate was lower in the 2017 third quarter due primarily to the recognition of greater federal Work Opportunity Tax Credits in the 2017 period.

39-Week Period Highlights

For the 39-week period ended November 3, 2017, net sales increased 8.5 percent over the comparable 2016 period to $17.3 billion. Same-store sales increased 2.6 percent, attributable to increases in average transaction amount and customer traffic. When compared to the 2016 39-week period, same-store sales increases were driven by positive results in the consumables, seasonal and apparel categories, partially offset by negative results in the home products category. Same-store sales results in the three non-consumables categories, when aggregated, were positive. The net sales increase was also positively affected by sales from new stores, modestly offset by sales from closed stores.

Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 30.3 percent in the 2017 39-week period, a decrease of 25 basis points from the comparable 2016 period. The gross profit rate decrease in the 2017 period as compared to the 2016 period was primarily attributable to higher markdowns, primarily for promotional activities, a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which generally have a lower gross profit rate than other product categories, and sales of lower margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumables sales. Partially offsetting these items were higher initial inventory markups and an improved rate of inventory shrink.

SG&A was 22.3 percent of net sales in the 2017 39-week period compared to 21.9 percent in the comparable 2016 period, an increase of 43 basis points. The SG&A increase was primarily attributable to increased retail labor expenses, primarily as a result of the Company's investment in store manager compensation, and increased occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales. Partially offsetting these increased expenses were a reduction in advertising costs as well as lower utilities and lower waste management costs primarily resulting from the Company's recycling efforts. As noted above, the 2017 period reflects expenses related to the impact of two hurricanes which occurred during the quarter, and the 2016 period reflects expenses associated with the acquisition of former Walmart Express store locations and related closure of existing stores, plus disaster-related expenses. The Company also recorded incremental expenses, primarily for lease termination costs, related to stores acquired in the second quarter of 2017 from a multi-price point discount retailer.

For the 2017 39-week period, the Company reported net income of $827 million, or $3.02 per diluted share, compared to net income of $837 million, or $2.95 per diluted share, for the 39-week 2016 period. Included in diluted earnings per share for the 2017 39-week period was an approximate $0.01 charge for the early retirement of long-term obligations, an approximate $0.02 charge primarily for the lease termination costs related to the stores acquired in the second quarter of 2017, and an estimated $0.05 hurricane-related net negative impact, driven by hurricane-related expenses. The 2016 39-week period included an approximate $0.04 benefit from the adoption of the share-based payment accounting standard and an approximate $0.05 charge for the Walmart Express store acquisition and disaster-related expenses.

The effective income tax rate for the 2017 39-week period was 36.8 percent compared to a rate of 36.1 percent for the comparable 2016 period. The effective income tax rate was higher in the 2017 39-week period due primarily to the recognition of a tax benefit of approximately $10.9 million in the 2016 period associated with stock based compensation that did not reoccur to the same extent in the 2017 period.

Financial and Store Growth Outlook

For the 52-week fiscal year ending February 2, 2018 (""fiscal 2017""), the Company is updating certain components of its guidance issued on August 31, 2017. The Company's guidance does not contemplate any potential impacts from U.S. corporate tax legislation reform.

The Company has narrowed its fiscal 2017 GAAP diluted earnings per share to $4.37 to $4.47, compared to its prior guidance range of $4.35 to $4.50. The current diluted earnings per share guidance range now includes the estimated net negative impact on the third quarter diluted earnings per share results of $0.05 related to the hurricanes. In addition, the Company now forecasts: 


   -- Fiscal 2017 net sales growth of approximately seven percent, compared to 
      its prior guidance range of five to seven percent growth, 
 
   -- Fiscal 2017 same-store sales growth of approximately 2.5 percent, 
      compared to its prior expectation that same-store sales would fall at the 
      upper end of the range of slightly positive to up two percent, and 
 
   -- Capital Expenditures between $700 million and $750 million, compared to 
      its prior guidance range of $715 million to $765 million. 

Share repurchases for fiscal 2017 continue to be forecasted at approximately $450 million.

For fiscal 2017, the Company continues to plan to open approximately 1,285 new stores, in addition to remodeling or relocating 760 stores.

For the 52-week period ending February 1, 2019, the Company plans to open approximately 900 new stores, remodel approximately 1,000 mature store locations and relocate approximately 100 stores for an approximate total of 2,000 real estate projects.

GOODLETTSVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 07, 2017-- 

Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG) today reported financial results for its fiscal 2017 third quarter (13 weeks) ended November 3, 2017.

""We are pleased with our overall third quarter results, which include a strong same-store sales growth of 4.3% and increases in both average transaction amount and customer traffic over the 2016 third quarter. During the quarter, we effectively balanced our same-store sales growth while achieving gross profit rate expansion and continuing our planned investments in the business.

""We remain excited about the future for Dollar General . For fiscal 2018, we have plans to execute approximately 2,000 real estate projects comprised of 900 new stores, 1,000 store remodels and 100 store relocations. We continue to believe that investing in the business through our high-return new store growth is the best use of our capital to help drive long-term shareholder value. Our new store growth is complemented with a significant increase in our store remodel program from fiscal 2017 that we view as an investment to enhance and consistently deliver on our brand promise to help our customers save time and money every day,"" said Todd Vasos , Dollar General's chief executive officer.

Third Quarter 2017 Highlights

Net sales increased 11.0 percent to $5.90 billion in the 2017 third quarter compared to $5.32 billion in the 2016 third quarter. Same-store sales increased 4.3 percent, attributable to increases in average transaction amount and customer traffic, including an estimated 30 to 35 basis point net benefit from hurricane-related sales. Same-store sales increases were driven by positive results in the consumables, seasonal and apparel categories, partially offset by negative results in the home products category. Same-store sales results in the three non-consumables categories, when aggregated, were positive. The net sales increase was also positively affected by sales from new stores, modestly offset by sales from closed stores.

Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 29.9 percent in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of eight basis points from the 2016 third quarter. The gross profit rate increase was primarily attributable to higher initial inventory markups and an improved rate of inventory shrink. Partially offsetting these items were a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which generally have a lower gross profit rate than other product categories, sales of lower-margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumables sales, and increased transportation costs.

Selling, general and administrative expense (""SG&A"") as a percentage of net sales was 22.9 percent in the 2017 third quarter compared to 22.5 percent in the 2016 third quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. The SG&A increase was primarily attributable to increased retail labor expenses, primarily as a result of the Company's investment in store manager compensation, and increased incentive compensation and occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales. Partially offsetting these increased expenses were lower utilities costs and a reduction in advertising costs. During the 2017 third quarter, the Company recorded incremental expenses of approximately $24.8 million, or 42 basis points, related to the impact of two hurricanes which occurred during the quarter as set forth below under ""Summary of Impact of Hurricanes on 2017 Third Quarter Results."" Similarly, in the 2016 third quarter, the Company incurred incremental charges of $13.0 million, or 25 basis points, associated with the acquisition of former Walmart Express store locations and the related closure of existing stores plus an incremental $7.7 million, or 14 basis points, of expenses primarily related to natural disasters.

The Company's net income was $253 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, in the 2017 third quarter, compared to net income of $235 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, in the 2016 third quarter. An estimated $0.05 hurricane-related net negative impact, driven by hurricane-related expenses, is included in diluted earnings per share for the 2017 third quarter. Similarly, the 2016 third quarter included an approximate $0.05 charge for the Walmart Express store acquisition and disaster-related expenses.

The effective income tax rate was 35.8 percent for the 2017 third quarter compared to a rate of 36.2 percent for the 2016 third quarter. The effective income tax rate was lower in the 2017 third quarter due primarily to the recognition of greater federal Work Opportunity Tax Credits in the 2017 period.

39-Week Period Highlights

For the 39-week period ended November 3, 2017, net sales increased 8.5 percent over the comparable 2016 period to $17.3 billion. Same-store sales increased 2.6 percent, attributable to increases in average transaction amount and customer traffic. When compared to the 2016 39-week period, same-store sales increases were driven by positive results in the consumables, seasonal and apparel categories, partially offset by negative results in the home products category. Same-store sales results in the three non-consumables categories, when aggregated, were positive. The net sales increase was also positively affected by sales from new stores, modestly offset by sales from closed stores.

Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 30.3 percent in the 2017 39-week period, a decrease of 25 basis points from the comparable 2016 period. The gross profit rate decrease in the 2017 period as compared to the 2016 period was primarily attributable to higher markdowns, primarily for promotional activities, a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which generally have a lower gross profit rate than other product categories, and sales of lower margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumables sales. Partially offsetting these items were higher initial inventory markups and an improved rate of inventory shrink.

SG&A was 22.3 percent of net sales in the 2017 39-week period compared to 21.9 percent in the comparable 2016 period, an increase of 43 basis points. The SG&A increase was primarily attributable to increased retail labor expenses, primarily as a result of the Company's investment in store manager compensation, and increased occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales. Partially offsetting these increased expenses were a reduction in advertising costs as well as lower utilities and lower waste management costs primarily resulting from the Company's recycling efforts. As noted above, the 2017 period reflects expenses related to the impact of two hurricanes which occurred during the quarter, and the 2016 period reflects expenses associated with the acquisition of former Walmart Express store locations and related closure of existing stores, plus disaster-related expenses. The Company also recorded incremental expenses, primarily for lease termination costs, related to stores acquired in the second quarter of 2017 from a multi-price point discount retailer.

For the 2017 39-week period, the Company reported net income of $827 million, or $3.02 per diluted share, compared to net income of $837 million, or $2.95 per diluted share, for the 39-week 2016 period. Included in diluted earnings per share for the 2017 39-week period was an approximate $0.01 charge for the early retirement of long-term obligations, an approximate $0.02 charge primarily for the lease termination costs related to the stores acquired in the second quarter of 2017, and an estimated $0.05 hurricane-related net negative impact, driven by hurricane-related expenses. The 2016 39-week period included an approximate $0.04 benefit from the adoption of the share-based payment accounting standard and an approximate $0.05 charge for the Walmart Express store acquisition and disaster-related expenses.

The effective income tax rate for the 2017 39-week period was 36.8 percent compared to a rate of 36.1 percent for the comparable 2016 period. The effective income tax rate was higher in the 2017 39-week period due primarily to the recognition of a tax benefit of approximately $10.9 million in the 2016 period associated with stock based compensation that did not reoccur to the same extent in the 2017 period.

      its prior guidance range of five to seven percent growth, 
 
   -- Fiscal 2017 same-store sales growth of approximately 2.5 percent, 
      compared to its prior expectation that same-store sales would fall at the 
      upper end of the range of slightly positive to up two percent, and 
 
   -- Capital Expenditures between $700 million and $750 million, compared to 
      its prior guidance range of $715 million to $765 million. 

Share repurchases for fiscal 2017 continue to be forecasted at approximately $450 million.

For fiscal 2017, the Company continues to plan to open approximately 1,285 new stores, in addition to remodeling or relocating 760 stores.

For the 52-week period ending February 1, 2019, the Company plans to open approximately 900 new stores, remodel approximately 1,000 mature store locations and relocate approximately 100 stores for an approximate total of 2,000 real estate projects.

2017-12-14,IBM,"Press Release: Walmart , JD.com , IBM and Tsinghua University Launch a Blockchain Food Safety Alliance in China","Walmart , JD.com , IBM and Tsinghua University Launch a Blockchain Food Safety Alliance in China

Collaboration to apply blockchain technology for food traceability to support offline and online consumers ","
BEIJING--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 14, 2017-- 

Walmart (NYSE: WMT), JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), IBM (NASDAQ: JD), (NYSE: IBM) , and Tsinghua University National Engineering Laboratory for E-Commerce Technologies announced today they will work together in a Blockchain Food Safety Alliance that will kick off with a collaboration designed to enhance food tracking, traceability and safety in China, to achieve greater transparency across the food supply chain.

The four companies will work together to create a standards-based method of collecting data about the origin, safety and authenticity of food, using blockchain technology to provide real-time traceability throughout the supply chain. This will encourage accountability and give suppliers, regulators and consumers greater insight and transparency into how food is handled, from the farm to consumers. This has traditionally been challenging due to complex and fragmented data sharing systems that are often paper-based and can be error-prone.

Walmart , JD, IBM and Tsinghua University will work with food supply chain providers and regulators to develop the standards, solutions and partnerships to enable a broad-based food safety ecosystem in China. IBM will provide its IBM Blockchain Platform and expertise, while Tsinghua University will act as a technical advisor sharing its expertise in the key technologies and the China food safety ecosystem. IBM and Tsinghua will collaborate with Walmart and JD to develop, optimize and roll out the technology to suppliers and retailers that join the alliance.

As a world leader in global food safety, Walmart works closely with suppliers, regulators, industry partners and the research community around the world. In China, it invests heavily in food safety research through the Walmart Food Safety and Collaboration Center and has promoted food safety, both through its own supplier network, as well as working with JD, which has rich omni-channel food supply chain management experience. The two have been able to leverage JD's expertise in the application of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, big data and other new technologies to protect consumers.

Following IBM and Walmart 's announcement in August of a new consortium to enhance food safety, this collaboration brings IBM 's blockchain food safety expertise to China. IBM , Walmart and Tsinghua University have piloted the use of blockchain to trace food items, including pork in China and mangoes in the U.S., as they move through the supply chain to store shelves. Recent testing by Walmart showed that applying blockchain reduced the time it took to trace a package of mangoes from the farm to the store from days or weeks to two seconds.

""As a global advocate for enhanced food safety, Walmart looks forward to deepening our work with IBM , Tsinghua University , JD and others throughout the food supply chain. Through collaboration, standardization, and adoption of new and innovative technologies, we can effectively improve traceability and transparency and help ensure the global food system remains safe for all,"" said Frank Yiannas, vice president, food safety and health at Walmart .

""Partnering with IBM , Tsinghua University and Walmart , all global leaders in traceability, gives our customers and partner brands unparalleled accountability,"" said Yongli Yu, President of JD Y, JD.com 's supply chain research unit. ""Throughout the world, and particularly in China, consumers increasingly want to know how their food is sourced, and JD is dedicated to using technology to promote complete transparency.""

""Blockchain holds incredible promise in delivering the transparency that is needed to help promote food safety across the whole supply chain. This is a fundamental reason why IBM believes so strongly in the impact this technology will have on business models,"" said Bridget van Kralingen , senior vice president, IBM Industry Platforms. ""By expanding our food safety work with Walmart and Tsinghua University in China and adding new collaborators like JD.com , the technology brings traceability and transparency to a broader network of food supply chain participants.""

""Tsinghua University is committed to in-depth research into food safety --one of the most important areas for improving quality of life in China and also around the world. We have already been working with IBM and Walmart to create a new model for food traceability, using blockchain to support supply chain transparency and auditability, and we see this new cooperation as an important next step in this endeavour,"" said Professor Yueting Chai from the National Engineering Laboratory for E-Commerce Technologies, Tsinghua University .

The collaboration is designed to help ensure brand owners' data privacy while helping them integrate their online and offline traceability for food safety and quality management channels. Companies that join the alliance will be able to share information using blockchain technology, and plans include them being able to choose the standards-based traceability solution that best suits their needs and legacy systems. This will in turn bring greater transparency to the supply chain and introduce new technologies to the retail sector designed to create a safer food environment and enhance the consumer experience.

The insights gained from the work in China will shed light on how blockchain technology can help improve processes such as recalls and verifications and enhance consumer confidence due to greater transparency in China and around the world.

2017-12-14,AMZN,"Tech Trader Daily: Amazon's Next Step to Compete with Fedex and UPS , Per Morgan Stanley -- Barron's Blog","Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak and colleagues this morning respond to an article from Tuesday in the industry trade publication ""DC Velocity,"" by author Mark Solomon, that said Amazon ( AMZN) is expanding its fulfillment efforts to become much more like a generalized parcel delivery service in competition with Fedex ( FDX) and UPS ( UPS ).

Solomon, in the DC Velocity article, wrote that Amazon is ""testing a program to offer two-day nationwide deliveries for all shippers, including those who aren't Amazon customers."" Solomon related that the program is ""being piloted in Los Angeles and Orange County.""","Nowak and colleagues this is a ""logical"" next step for Amazon. The company had been providing first "" fulfillment by Amazon,"" or FBA, where it convinces sellers on Amazon.com to use its warehouses.

But then Amazon added "" Seller Flex,"" in which Amazon picks up packages from a seller's warehouse if they prefer.

Now, writes Nowak, Amazon ""reportedly 'wants to pick up all of (a customer's) orders regardless of what they are and where they're going,' -- indicating intentions to become a full-fledged parcel carrier,"" quoting from the Solomon article.

Nowak sees Amazon having the resources, and he sees the company further reducing its reliance on UPS and Fedex :

AMZN plans to use its own assets. According to the report, AMZN is willing to ship items of all sizes (not just eCommerce packages) and is planning to offer all deliveries using its two-day Prime program. This will be executed through the many links in its in-house network including last mile, thousands of tractors and trailers, 40 B767, dedicated rail IM, global freight forwarding license, in-house freight brokerage app and more -- click links to see notes. Reducing reliance on UPS and FDX. The report also states that AMZN is seeking to reduce its reliance on the big carriers and will only rely on outside providers on ""high confidence"" routes. This makes sense to us as our own work has suggested that AMZN can be up to 2/3rd cheaper than legacy parcel avg. rev/unit at similar delivery density (see our Parcel report here), which was seemingly confirmed by AMZN on its recent 3Q conf. call. Moreover, UPS has also been struggling to meet on-time requirements this peak season, likely exacerbating AMZN's concerns.

Amazon today is up $9.68, or 0.8%, at $1,173.81.

INDIANAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 21, 2017-- ","Indianapolis Power & Light Company (IPL), a subsidiary of The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES), filed its regulatory rate review today with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) to cover the cost of replacing older, outdated coal plants with one of the cleanest, most efficient natural gas plants ever to be built in Indiana. If IPL's request is approved by the IURC, new rates are expected to be effective by the end of 2018.

""At IPL, we have a responsibility to find the balance between cleaner energy solutions and affordability while maintaining reliability that our customers expect,"" said Rafael Sanchez, IPL President and CEO. ""Our investments in advanced technology have enabled us to significantly reduce our dependence on coal and transition to a more balanced energy mix all while maintaining one of the lowest rates among investor-owned utilities in Indiana.""

2017-12-04,NWS,Blue Apron Shoots Up As Another Exec Resigns --Market Talk,"1031 ET - Blue Apron Holdings is up 23% as the meal-kit company says its senior vice president of operations and fulfillment has resigned, the third in a string of high-level departures. Pablo Cussatti, previously an operations head at Pinnacle Foods , Dean Foods and PepsiCo , oversaw Blue Apron's troubled opening of a new manufacturing plant that has weighed on profits. Blue Apron's CEO resigned last week and its CFO took over as the New York City company seeks to reassure investors who have seen their stock tank since its June IPO. The company says it has hired a search firm to replace Cussatti. The single-day stock surge is the greatest percentage leap since the company went public in June. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)","1028 ET - The pace of US oil exports accelerated this fall thanks to cheap tanker economics, says David St Amand of Navigistics Consulting. The US is in the rare situation of being both a major crude oil importer and a major exporter, which means tankers can deliver Mideast crude to the US Gulf Coast and then refill and move to other markets in Latin America or Europe. Those so-called ""backhaul"" and ""triangular"" routes have helped reduce tanker rates from the US. For instance, Mideast-to-Japan rates are now at WS70 (or 70% of the Worldscale flat tanker rate) while Mideast to the US Gulf is WS28. Current shipping costs from Corpus Christi, Texas to Rotterdam runs between $1.12 to $2.30 a barrel, depending on the size of the oil tanker. From Corpus to Korea it's between $2.90 and $4.30 a barrel, and from Corpus to Singapore it's between $2.66 to $5.13 a barrel. (lynn.cook@wsj.com; @LynnJCook)

1015 ET - The broad rally that's taken the Dow Jones Industrial Average up nearly 300 points Monday has left behind one sector: technology. Shares of technology companies in the S&P 500 were recently down 0.8%, the only group of the broad index's 11 sectors trading in negative territory. The losses weighed on the Nasdaq Composite, which edged down 0.1% as the Dow industrials jumped 1.2%. While the Republican plan to cut corporate tax rates should lift earnings growth broadly, helping US stocks, some analysts have said it could also spur a rotation out of outperforming names into relative underperformers. Those analysts believe tech stocks in the S&P 500, which have nearly doubled the broad index's gains this year, are vulnerable to a pullback. (akane.otani@wsj.com; @akaneotani)

1011 ET - CVS's $69B deal for Aetna couldn't come at a better time for Goldman Sachs , whose lead in the annual M&A rankings--a deep fount of bragging rights on Wall Street--was looking a bit thin heading into year-end. As of Friday, Goldman had a lead of $50B over chief rival Morgan Stanley in global deals and $30B in the US, about half its margin this time last year. Goldman advised CVS while both Morgan Stanly and JPMorgan were absent from the deal, which was heavy on boutique advisers. That should cement Goldman's lock on the top spot for 2017. The bank will pick up extra fees for helping to line up $49B in financing, a coup in its effort to be more of a takeover lender. (liz.hoffman@wsj.com; @lizrhoffman)

NBF says BoC ""just cannot ignore the strong labor market,"" which added nearly 80K jobs in November, and the jobless rate fell to a near-decade low and below the 6% level. NBF adds that it ""would not be surprised,"" if USDCAD revisits the 1.25 level in early 2018 as BoC again embraces a hawkish tilt. (paul.vieira@wsj.com, @paulvieira)

0951 ET - US government bond yields rise as investors speculate that some version of the Republican plan to revamp taxes with lower rates for corporations will gain final passage, boosting growth and locking in higher equity prices. Investors also sell bonds overnight amid strength in global stock markets. Optimism is likely to remain tempered by the recognition that Congress must pass some sort of spending plan to fund the government after existing spending authorization expires December 8. After that, there's also the need to increase the debt ceiling. Aside from political considerations, many investors will be waiting for the December 8 jobs report. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield rises to 2.397% from 2.363% on Friday. (Daniel.kruger@wsj.com)

0948 ET - Boeing and other aerospace stocks make strong early gains, lifted by proposed U.S. tax reform as well as IATA's report of a 7.2% bump in passenger traffic during October. Boeing rises around 2%, with commercial aero shares outperforming defense stocks, the latter weighed slightly by the prospect of another short-term Pentagon budget when the current one runs out Friday. Tax experts said the impact on aerospace will hinge on reconciling language on a proposed foreign excise tax. (doug.cameron@wsj.com; @dougcameron)

0943 ET - Shares of banks are rallying shortly after the opening bell, lifted by the latest signs of progress on a US tax overhaul. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index of large US lenders was recently up 2.3%, on course for its fifth consecutive session of gains. JPMorgan rose 3%, Morgan Stanley added 2.1% and Goldman Sachs rose 1.4%. Corporate tax cuts could boost earnings growth and lend additional fuel to the US stock rally, analysts say. Shares of banks, which some analysts say pay among the highest effective tax rates of any major industry, have rallied in recent sessions as Republicans have drawn closer to pushing a tax bill to the White House.

The insurer's CEO, Mark Bertolini , won't retain a management role, though he will join the combined company's board. While offering no specifics about retention packages, CVS CEO Larry Merlo says he's ""confident that we'll be able to work out the specifics so that there are many of those individuals that will want to continue on and be a part of this exciting journey."" He notes that Aetna will be run as a separate business unit within CVS and plays up his plans to consult with the current Aetna CEO and ""continue to pick his brain."" (anna.mathews@wsj.com)

Pablo Cussatti, previously an operations head at Pinnacle Foods , Dean Foods and PepsiCo , oversaw Blue Apron's troubled opening of a new manufacturing plant that has weighed on profits. Blue Apron's CEO resigned last week and its CFO took over as the New York City company seeks to reassure investors who have seen their stock tank since its June IPO. The company says it has hired a search firm to replace Cussatti. The single-day stock surge is the greatest percentage leap since the company went public in June. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)","1028 ET - The pace of US oil exports accelerated this fall thanks to cheap tanker economics, says David St Amand of Navigistics Consulting. The US is in the rare situation of being both a major crude oil importer and a major exporter, which means tankers can deliver Mideast crude to the US Gulf Coast and then refill and move to other markets in Latin America or Europe. Those so-called ""backhaul"" and ""triangular"" routes have helped reduce tanker rates from the US. For instance, Mideast-to-Japan rates are now at WS70 (or 70% of the Worldscale flat tanker rate) while Mideast to the US Gulf is WS28. Current shipping costs from Corpus Christi, Texas to Rotterdam runs between $1.12 to $2.30 a barrel, depending on the size of the oil tanker. From Corpus to Korea it's between $2.90 and $4.30 a barrel, and from Corpus to Singapore it's between $2.66 to $5.13 a barrel. (lynn.cook@wsj.com; @LynnJCook)

At the UBS conference, Cavanagah says Comcast is happy with its current assets, which include over 20M cable subscribers as well as NBCUniversal , home to the NBC broadcast network and several cable channels including USA and MSNBC. Cavanagh did say the company is always asking, ""are there things out there we could do that would create value for shareholders.""

1015 ET - The broad rally that's taken the Dow Jones Industrial Average up nearly 300 points Monday has left behind one sector: technology. Shares of technology companies in the S&P 500 were recently down 0.8%, the only group of the broad index's 11 sectors trading in negative territory. The losses weighed on the Nasdaq Composite, which edged down 0.1% as the Dow industrials jumped 1.2%. While the Republican plan to cut corporate tax rates should lift earnings growth broadly, helping US stocks, some analysts have said it could also spur a rotation out of outperforming names into relative underperformers. Those analysts believe tech stocks in the S&P 500, which have nearly doubled the broad index's gains this year, are vulnerable to a pullback. (akane.otani@wsj.com; @akaneotani)

1011 ET - CVS's $69B deal for Aetna couldn't come at a better time for Goldman Sachs , whose lead in the annual M&A rankings--a deep fount of bragging rights on Wall Street--was looking a bit thin heading into year-end. As of Friday, Goldman had a lead of $50B over chief rival Morgan Stanley in global deals and $30B in the US, about half its margin this time last year. Goldman advised CVS while both Morgan Stanly and JPMorgan were absent from the deal, which was heavy on boutique advisers. That should cement Goldman's lock on the top spot for 2017. The bank will pick up extra fees for helping to line up $49B in financing, a coup in its effort to be more of a takeover lender. (liz.hoffman@wsj.com; @lizrhoffman)

In court papers, Apache lawyers ask a bankruptcy judge to allow the lawsuit over $18 million in unpaid bills that Apache says Castex owes to advance in state court. Castex's bankruptcy filing earlier this year automatically halted litigation. Amid the energy-price slump, Castex struck a deal with its lenders owed roughly $390 million who agreed to take ownership of the company as repayment. Castex officials blamed the company's financial troubles on an ill-timed expansion that took place in 2014, shortly before new natural-gas drilling techniques led to an oversupply of the resource and triggered a decline in natural gas prices.

1704 ET - Loblaw, Canada's biggest grocer and retailer, says its Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacy unit will distribute medical marijuana supplied by Aphria, the country's second-biggest cannabis producer. The tie-up is Loblaw's first supplier announcement in the medical-marijuana space following reports it applied for a distribution license last year. It is expected Aphria's products will be sold online, as Canadian regulations currently restrict the sale of medical cannabis in retail pharmacies, the company says. Canada is expected to legalize marijuana by July, leading to a flurry of deals announced by the country's publicly-listed cannabis companies.

Verheul, in a rare public appearance before a parliamentary trade committee, said US proposals dealing with autos, the dispute-settlement process, government procurement, and a sunset clause are ""extreme,"" echoing language used by senior Canadian officials such as Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland .

Among the largest packaged food categories, about two-thirds have higher prices than a year ago, and the percentage of items sold at a discount decreased, according to Barclays analysis of Nielsen data.

1520 ET - US air-safety regulators seek to mandate enhanced pre-flight checks of 3,200 twin-engine Boeing jets before each extended overwater flight, aiming to ensure that fuel-line valves don't malfunction during such trips. Combined with an engine shutdown, a failed valve can result in fuel starvation. Under the FAA 's proposed rule, airlines will have 120 days to change pre-flight procedures or minimum requirements for functioning equipment on 737s, 757s, 767s, 777s and 787s. The aims is to guarantee that if a valve stops working in the closed position--which the agency said can remain undiscovered for several flights--it won't block fuel in certain tanks from flowing to the remaining operating engine.

1505 ET - Federal tax reform legislation could boost earnings for industrial conglomerates and distributors of industrial supplies by an average of 11% in 2019, says RBC Capital Markets . The earnings gain would primarily come from a lower US corporate tax rate and the ability to immediately expense capital investments. Among the biggest profit gainers projected by RBC are distributors W.W. Grainger --up 29%--and HD Supply --up 22%. Companies benefiting the least are those that have moved offshore to tax-friendly havens like Ireland where they're already taxed at reduced rates. RBC estimates that corporate expats Eaton, Ingersoll-Rand and Pentair would each gain less than 5%, mostly from expensing capex. Grainger up 4.5% at $228.19.

His hardline comments come as Nafta talks are at a standstill. The next full round of talks is scheduled for Montreal in late January. (paul.vieira@wsj.com, @paulvieira)

1612 ET - Farmers and ranchers will benefit from President Trump's move to slash the size of national monuments in Utah, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation . The group says the decision helps unwind the Obama administration's abusive ""quarantine"" of millions of acres of grazing land, according to AFBF President Zippy Duvall, who says rural Americans suffered under a ""remote bureaucracy."" Duvall sees Trump's move in keeping with the original spirit of the 1906 Antiquities Act and follows similar reductions by past presidents like Taft and Kennedy. (jacob.bunge@wsj.com; @jacobbunge)

1607 ET - Financial companies rise sharply following the passage of the GOP's tax-overhaul bill in the Senate over the weekend, with Bank of America up 3.4% and JP Morgan up 2.1%. But tech stocks fall, taking the Nasdaq and S&P with them. Advanced Micro Devices falls 6.5% and Activision declines 5.4%. The Dow and S&P end well below earlier highs, with the Dow up 0.2% to 24290, the S&P off 0.1% to 2639 and the Nasdaq sinking 1.1% to 6775. Oil prices fall 1.6% to $57.42 after getting a boost from OPEC production cuts last week. (jonathan.vuocolo@wsj.com; @jonvuocolo)

1554 ET - Barclays thinks some of the packaged food industry's problems this year may be imaginary. The challenge that seems to worry investors most is the pressure from retailers to lower prices, ""however, while price pressure may yet come, the data thus far simply do not bear out this concern."" Among the largest packaged food categories, about two-thirds have higher prices than a year ago, and the percentage of items sold at a discount decreased, according to Barclays analysis of Nielsen data. Barclays says margins have decreased but that's due to higher freight costs, food prices and customer service costs. Pricing pressure isn't the ""culprit."" (annie.gasparro@wsj.com)

1520 ET - US air-safety regulators seek to mandate enhanced pre-flight checks of 3,200 twin-engine Boeing jets before each extended overwater flight, aiming to ensure that fuel-line valves don't malfunction during such trips. Combined with an engine shutdown, a failed valve can result in fuel starvation. Under the FAA 's proposed rule, airlines will have 120 days to change pre-flight procedures or minimum requirements for functioning equipment on 737s, 757s, 767s, 777s and 787s. The aims is to guarantee that if a valve stops working in the closed position--which the agency said can remain undiscovered for several flights--it won't block fuel in certain tanks from flowing to the remaining operating engine.

1505 ET - Court-appointed Takata special master has launched $850M restitution fund to compensate auto makers shouldering recall costs for explosion-prone air bags manufactured by Japanese automotive supplier. Fund, created as part of Takata's agreement to plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing for lapses with air bags, launched at end of last week, says Eric Green , Boston law professor and mediator that federal judge in Detroit selected as special master in supplier's criminal case. Notices going out to more than 50 vehicle manufacturers who purchased air bags and might be eligible for money, he says. Distribution to manufacturers to be determined based on percentage of faulty air bags purchased from Takata as of Dec 31, 2016. Special master set to determine allocation of $125M earmarked for people with personal injury or wrongful death claims at a later date. (mike.spector@wsj.com; @MikeSpectorWSJ)

1505 ET - Federal tax reform legislation could boost earnings for industrial conglomerates and distributors of industrial supplies by an average of 11% in 2019, says RBC Capital Markets . The earnings gain would primarily come from a lower US corporate tax rate and the ability to immediately expense capital investments. Among the biggest profit gainers projected by RBC are distributors W.W. Grainger --up 29%--and HD Supply --up 22%. Companies benefiting the least are those that have moved offshore to tax-friendly havens like Ireland where they're already taxed at reduced rates. RBC estimates that corporate expats Eaton, Ingersoll-Rand and Pentair would each gain less than 5%, mostly from expensing capex. Grainger up 4.5% at $228.19. Eaton, Ingersoll and Pentair trading slightly lower. (robert.tita@wsj.com; @bob_tita)

Press Release: S&PGR Rates Packaging Corp. Of America's Sr Unsec Notes 'BBB'","
 
 
The following is a press release from Standard & Poor's : 
 
NEW YORK (S&P Global Ratings) Dec. 11, 2017--S&P Global Ratings today assigned 
its 'BBB' issue-level rating to Packaging Corp. of America 's (PCA ) $500 
million senior unsecured notes due 2020 and $500 million senior unsecured 
notes due 2027. 
 
PCA  intends to use the proceeds from these issuances to fully repay its $976 
million of outstanding term loans and for general corporate purposes. 
 
Our rating on Lake Forest, Ill.-based PCA  reflects the company's established 
presence in the stable U.S. packaging market, vertically integrated operating 
platform, and consistent industry-leading operating margins. These factors are 
somewhat offset by the company's limited geographic diversity. As of Sept. 30, 
2017, we estimate that PCA 's adjusted funds from operations (FFO)-to-debt 
ratio and debt-to-EBITDA metric were 33.6% and 2.1x, respectively. Over the 
next 12-24 months, we expect the company to manage its operations such that 
its FFO-to-debt is between 30% and 35% while its debt-to-EBITDA metric is 
about 2x, which are levels consistent with the current rating. 
 
For the complete corporate rationale, please see our most recent summary 
analysis on PCA , published Oct. 16, 2017, on RatingsDirect.

2017-12-12,HAL,Who Fracks the Best Wells? -- Market Talk,"1222 ET - Do oil field service giants Halliburton and Schlumberger frack the best wells? Yes, but not by much, according to AB Bernstein. Analyst Colin Davies looked at the productivity of wells completed by the two companies in Texas' Permian basin and found they deliver only slightly more productive wells than their smaller, and often cheaper, competitors. Halliburton edged Schlumberger , Davies found. The analysis could be important because both companies offer more expensive approaches covering a range of services on the premise that the cost is worthwhile because they produce more productive wells. ""While the two leading companies do in general deliver slightly more productive wells, other providers and unbundled approaches can also deliver impressive results,"" Davies wrote. (christopher.matthews@wsj.com; @cmatthews9)","1218 ET - Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood says her company's Azure cloud-computing unit sees increasing competition for business with Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform business. Hood, who made the comments at the Wells Fargo Tech Summit in Park City, Utah, last week, says ""we've been talking about seeing them in this market for years, but I would say we've seen more of them in the past few quarters than we've seen before,"" according to a transcript of the event. Google Cloud held a 2.3% share of the global cloud infrastructure market, compared to Microsoft Azure's 7.1% in 2016, according to Gartner . Amazon's cloud-computing unit dominated the market with a 44.2% share. Hood also showered Google Cloud boss Diane Greene with praise as well, calling her ""a winner"" and ""an excellent leader and an established enterprise CEO."" (jay.greene@wsj.com; @greene)

1207 ET - Airbnb could end up in a costly showdown with the city of Paris, one of its most profitable markets. Paris is giving Airbnb until early January to remove a sample 1,000 listings that it says don't comply with a new law that obliges Parisians renting out their primary residences on a short-term basis to display a city registration number in their listings. The city says the registration numbers help track compliance with a 120-night cap per year. But Airbnb has said won't force its hosts to display the numbers because the site doesn't know which listings are legally required to show them. Last month, in an effort to diffuse tensions, Airbnb said it would start blocking hosts in central Paris from listing apartments beyond the 120-night-per-year cap. But the move was met with scorn by city officials who said it should apply to all of Paris. If unresolved, the fight could end up in court.

1113 ET - A global grain glut continues to squeeze the world's largest crop traders, and Archer Daniels Midland takes another step to streamline operations, announcing the sale of its soybean-processing facilities in Bolivia. Lima-based Inversiones Piuranas SA will acquire ADM's Bolivian processing plant and nine grain silos in the deal, which ADM expects to close in the first half of 2018, while not disclosing any sale price. ADM's net income dropped 44% in its most recent quarter, as US grain exports slowed and persistently low crop prices have cut into trading and processing profits for the companies that dominate agricultural commodity trading. ADM shares rise 0.5%, and are down 8.6% so far this year. (jacob.bunge@wsj.com; @jacobbunge)

1109 ET - An esports league under development by The NBA and videogame publisher Take-Two has an official logo, the organizations announced Monday, though a start date has yet to be revealed. The NBA and Take-Two haven't made any major announcements about the league since May when it revealed that 17 NBA teams--including the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors --would field esports squads for matches of Take-Two's ""NBA 2K"" videogame starting in 2018. The joint venture was first unveiled in February, a few months after Activision disclosed it was building a city-based esports league around its ""Overwatch"" game. That league kicked off pre-season matches last week, and the official season is slated to begin on Jan. 10. (sarah.needleman@wsj.com; @saraheneedleman)

This will allow them to gauge interest on the pipeline system that would begin service in 2H 2019 and move crude oil from west Texas to refining and export destination markets along the Gulf of Mexico such as Corpus Christi, Freeport and Houston. The joint statement says the line would have an initial 385k bpd capacity, but that number could rise depending on shipping interest. There's been a rush recently among midstream companies to start providing transport options for oil companies in the Permian basin of west Texas and New Mexico, where production now stands at about 2.7M bpd, a hefty portion of total US output of 9.5M bpd.

1013 ET - There were just under 6 million job openings at the end of October, the Labor Department says. The number of openings ticked down from 6.18 million at the end of September, but remained near the highest level on record back to 2000. The rate at which employers hired, or filled those openings, improved in October and the rate at which workers were dismissed from their jobs slowed slightly. The data is consistent with other measures of the labor market showing some firms are finding it more challenging to find workers to fill jobs. (eric.morath@wsj.com; @ericmorath)

1003 ET - Few new refineries will start producing fuel in 2018, but roughly 800,000 barrels a day of new distillation capacity will come online next year as existing plants debottleneck their systems, according to OPEC . Kuwait's national oil company is an investor in a new 200,000 b/d plant in Vietnam, which will run Kuwaiti crude. In Canada, a 50,000 b/d refinery in Redwater, Alberta will enter its first full year of operation - the first such plant built in Canada in 30 years. But the small refinery will process Canadian crude and sell refined products locally, so it's not expected to impact trade flows, according to Poten & Partners , which tracks fuel movements. Another new refinery with somewhat limited trade impact on oil is the 200,000 b/d Star refinery that Azerbaijan's state oil is building in Turkey. It will run primarily Azeri crude, but also buy from Russia and Iraq. (lynn.cook@wsj.com; @LynnJCook)

0956 ET - Hedge fund Elliott Management continues to push for a higher price in Qualcomm 's planned purchase of NXP Semiconductors or another deal as it released a public website Monday laying out its valuation estimate for the business. Elliott confirms a November WSJ report that it had enlisted investment bank UBS Group to help in its efforts. The deal, announced in October 2016, valued NXP at $39B, or $110 a share. Since then there has been a slew of deals in the space. Elliott said it believes NXP should be valued at $135 a share. Shares of NXP rose 1.1% to $116.50. (austen.hufford@wsj.com; @austenhufford)

0948 ET - A refinery operator in Poland is testing out US and Canadian crude oil in its Gdansk plant ahead of a big expansion. Grupa LOTUS is upgrading its refinery on the Baltic Sea and adding between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels a day of capacity in 2018, which will impact trade flows, according to Poten & Partners , which tracks tanker shipments. Russian Urals crude will remain a key feedstock for the Polish refinery, and LOTUS also sources oil from the North Sea and the Middle East. But it recently bought two cargoes of light, sweet crude from the US and before that a cargo of Hibernia crude pumped off the east coast of Canada to test in the plant, Poten says. Poland is heavily dependent on Russia for oil and gas, but earlier this year it imported its first cargo of US-sourced liquefied natural gas (LNG). (lynn.cook@wsj.com; @LynnJCook)

There's been a rush recently among midstream companies to start providing transport options for oil companies in the Permian basin of west Texas and New Mexico, where production now stands at about 2.7M bpd, a hefty portion of total US output of 9.5M bpd.

1013 ET - There were just under 6 million job openings at the end of October, the Labor Department says. The number of openings ticked down from 6.18 million at the end of September, but remained near the highest level on record back to 2000. The rate at which employers hired, or filled those openings, improved in October and the rate at which workers were dismissed from their jobs slowed slightly. The data is consistent with other measures of the labor market showing some firms are finding it more challenging to find workers to fill jobs. (eric.morath@wsj.com; @ericmorath)

1003 ET - Few new refineries will start producing fuel in 2018, but roughly 800,000 barrels a day of new distillation capacity will come online next year as existing plants debottleneck their systems, according to OPEC . Kuwait's national oil company is an investor in a new 200,000 b/d plant in Vietnam, which will run Kuwaiti crude. In Canada, a 50,000 b/d refinery in Redwater, Alberta will enter its first full year of operation - the first such plant built in Canada in 30 years. But the small refinery will process Canadian crude and sell refined products locally, so it's not expected to impact trade flows, according to Poten & Partners , which tracks fuel movements. Another new refinery with somewhat limited trade impact on oil is the 200,000 b/d Star refinery that Azerbaijan's state oil is building in Turkey. It will run primarily Azeri crude, but also buy from Russia and Iraq. (lynn.cook@wsj.com; @LynnJCook)

0956 ET - Hedge fund Elliott Management continues to push for a higher price in Qualcomm 's planned purchase of NXP Semiconductors or another deal as it released a public website Monday laying out its valuation estimate for the business. Elliott confirms a November WSJ report that it had enlisted investment bank UBS Group to help in its efforts. The deal, announced in October 2016, valued NXP at $39B, or $110 a share. Since then there has been a slew of deals in the space. Elliott said it believes NXP should be valued at $135 a share. Shares of NXP rose 1.1% to $116.50. (austen.hufford@wsj.com; @austenhufford)

0948 ET - A refinery operator in Poland is testing out US and Canadian crude oil in its Gdansk plant ahead of a big expansion. Grupa LOTUS is upgrading its refinery on the Baltic Sea and adding between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels a day of capacity in 2018, which will impact trade flows, according to Poten & Partners , which tracks tanker shipments. Russian Urals crude will remain a key feedstock for the Polish refinery, and LOTUS also sources oil from the North Sea and the Middle East. But it recently bought two cargoes of light, sweet crude from the US and before that a cargo of Hibernia crude pumped off the east coast of Canada to test in the plant, Poten says. Poland is heavily dependent on Russia for oil and gas, but earlier this year it imported its first cargo of US-sourced liquefied natural gas (LNG). (lynn.cook@wsj.com; @LynnJCook)

2017-12-11,SHW,Big Paint Companies Still Look Primed for an M&A Wave,"One might be forgiven for thinking that some paints just don't mix.

Three megadeals in the global paint industry have failed this year: PPG Industries ended its three-month pursuit of European leader Akzo Nobel in June; Akzo aborted its subsequent suggestion of a merger of equals with Axalta Coatings Systems after Japan's Nippon Paint made its own cash bid; and recently the Nippon-Axalta talks broke down.","Yet the strategic logic driving big deals has only grown. Debt remains cheap, and paint producers have been caught this year between lackluster sales and spiraling raw-material costs. The savings available from combining purchasing budgets look more attractive than ever.

It is tempting to bet a deal will happen. Akzo used to be the obvious target, but now a takeover of Axalta looks more plausible.

Nippon's offer came in around $37 a share. This looks low. Last year industry leader Sherwin-Williams paid 14.2 times expected earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation for Valspar. Applying that multiple to Axalta's 2018 forecast Ebitda gives a share price of roughly $43.

Akzo's all-share offer for Axalta would have been worth more than $37 a share, but only assuming optimistic cost savings estimates of over $700 million. By comparison, Sherwin-Williams estimated only $280 million of savings through its combination with Valspar, which is roughly twice the size of Akzo-Axalta.

Not only do the savings look unrealistic, but extracting them would have been up to Akzo's new chief, who was slated to lead a combined entity, according to people familiar with the talks.

Shareholders, including activist Elliott Management, failed to bring Akzo's management into talks with PPG earlier this year; they might also fail to hold them to enforce those savings. It is hard to see why Axalta's investors, led by Berkshire Hathaway, would accept this governance downgrade.

That leaves the question of whether Nippon is prepared to pay more. Synergies could be up to $300 million, and combining big Japanese and U.S. automotive-paint players makes strategic sense. But Nippon has issued mixed messages about its appetite for the necessary leverage or equity dilution.

Axalta's stock languishes at roughly $32 -- up from about $28 before Akzo's interest became public in late October but well below a takeout price. Nothing is predictable in M&A, but there is probably enough chance that Axalta again becomes a target to justify a bet.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 11, 2017-- ","Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E ) paid property taxes of more than $230 million this fall to the 50 counties where the energy company owns property and operates gas and electric infrastructure that serves 16 million Californians. The tax payments help support essential public services like education and public safety.

The semi-annual property tax payments made today cover the period from July 1 to December 31, 2017.

Total payments for the full tax year of July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018 are estimated to total more than $461 million--an increase of $50 million, or 12 percent, compared with the prior fiscal year.

""Property tax payments provide crucial resources to the many communities where we live and work, supporting everything from education to public safety. By continuing to make local investments in gas and electric infrastructure, we are not only creating one of the safest and most reliable energy systems in the country, we're investing in the local economy and helping our communities thrive,"" said Jason Wells , senior vice president and chief financial officer for PG&E.

PG&E invested more than $5.7 billion last year and expects to invest $5.9 billion this year to enhance and upgrade its gas and electrical infrastructure across Northern and Central California.

PG&E supports the communities it serves in a variety of ways. In 2016, PG&E provided more than $28 million in charitable contributions to enrich local educational opportunities, preserve the environment, and support economic vitality and emergency preparedness and safety. PG&E employees provide thousands of hours of volunteer service in their local communities. The company also offers a broad spectrum of economic development services to help local businesses grow.

2017-06-21,INTC,YouTube Ad Mess Divides Brands,"Google's YouTube is still struggling to bring back some prominent advertisers months after a backlash over ads appearing alongside offensive videos, but it is winning over new business from others, reflecting the site's importance as a digital marketing platform.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc., AT&T Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Starbucks Corp., Procter & Gamble Co. and at least a dozen other major brands or government agencies haven't returned to the site, those institutions and people familiar with the situation say. They pulled their spending after news organizations in March revealed that their ads ran alongside extremist or racist videos.","But some companies have resumed spending on YouTube ads -- including General Motors Co., Coca-Cola Co., Lyft Inc. and McDonald's Corp.'s U.K. unit -- after the site improved its technology to screen videos, committed to employing more human reviewers and gave marketers more control over where their ads appeared. YouTube also issued refunds to some companies.

The mixed response from advertisers shows their ""brand safety"" concerns are serious and could linger, but also aren't insurmountable, as long as Google continues its efforts to ease marketers' fears.

YouTube said in a statement: ""Many advertisers never left and many have decided to come back. While they know that no system can be perfect, they appreciate the actions we've taken and know we are taking this seriously and are committed to getting better and better.""

Google on Sunday also announced a series of changes to curb extremist videos on its site, including adding more technology and human reviewers to flag them and making less extreme ones harder to find.

Many of the marketers still on the sidelines say they are waiting for complete reassurance that poor ad placements won't happen again.

A series of news stories about ads running alongside controversial YouTube videos sparked advertisers to pull spending in late March. In the 90 days from March 15 to June 13, digital-ad research firm Pathmatics estimated spending on ads that ran before YouTube videos or displayed on the YouTube site fell by 17% to $739 million, compared with the previous 90 days. However, when compared to the same period in 2016, such spending rose by 50%, according to the data. Pathmatics didn't capture data from YouTube's mobile app.

The data show that despite deep cuts from some big brands, other companies significantly boosted spending over the period, including Apple Inc., Intel Corp. and website-creation firm Wix.com Ltd. Intel declined comment. Apple and Wix didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other signs also look good for YouTube. A poll of 316 marketers -- including 200 decision makers from the top 200 advertisers in the U.S. -- conducted in May by research consultancy Advertiser Perceptions found that 39% of respondents were likely to spend ""a good deal more"" with YouTube this year than last. Just 12% said they planned to spend less this year and 41% said there would be no change. Among the remainder, some weren't YouTube advertisers.

The data suggest that despite advertisers' concerns, YouTube's scale and data make it irresistible for many marketers.

Google parent Alphabet Inc. posted a 22% increase in revenue to $24.8 billion in the first quarter, mostly driven by its ad business, but those figures largely preceded the backlash. Investors are watching second-quarter results closely for any impact.

Many marketers have ramped up oversight of where their ads appear. Audits run by ad agencies have sometimes showed that even YouTube channels the company brands as ""Google Preferred"" -- and charges more for -- can include videos advertisers don't consider premium. These could include footage of people playing the popular children's game ""Minecraft."" Such videos aren't in bad taste, but their viewers likely include many children, who aren't a priority for most marketers.

YouTube said its Google Preferred channels include many different categories of content, including material aimed at teens, and that it works with marketers to put their ads on the right videos.

Many advertisers are now moving from ""blacklisting"" videos they wouldn't want to be associated with, to ""whitelisting"" the channels they deem appropriate. Whitelisting can have the effect of narrowing a company's ad buy.

Enterprise Holdings Inc., owner of Enterprise Rent-a-Car, for example, is working with its media-buying agency, Omnicom Media Group, to test a program that scores hundreds of thousands of popular videos based on their suitability for ads.

Marketers have seized on the uproar to press for long-sought changes. After the backlash, Google agreed to let independent measurement firms monitor where marketers' ads appear.

""I think brands like giving Google a bloody nose as they have been so reliant and plowed so much money"" into the company, said Ryan Kangisser, founder of ad consulting firm Stack I/O.",822,article,",c32,c151,c31,cbrand,neqac,reqrap,c15,ccat,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,redit,reqr,"

Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG: NYSE) By Credit Suisse ($458.91, June 20, 2017)","We are lowering our estimated second-quarter earnings per share for Chipotle Mexican Grill to $2.00 (from $2.33), putting us below consensus of $2.43. Our 2017/2018 EPS estimate moves to $6.98/$10.77, respectively (from $7.31/$11.16), below consensus $8.46/$12.19, respectively.

Following meetings with investors Monday, Chipotle (ticker: CMG) issued a press release after the close to ""reaffirm and clarify"" several guidance items. Fiscal 2017 guidance on same-store sales (SSS) and unit growth reiterated, but updated guidance on second-quarter food costs and other operating expenses was unfavorable to our model and consensus (per Consensus Metrix). No update on second-quarter-to-date SSS trends. Bottom line, this update should lead to modest downward earnings revisions.

[We rate Chipotle at Neutral and maintain a $425 price target.]

Management guided to second-quarter cost-of-goods-sold (COGS) margin of about 34.2%, about 100 basis points above our prior model and about 40 basis points above consensus. Guidance on the second quarter other operating expenses as percentage of sales guided to ""at or slightly higher than reported for the first quarter."" This implies other operating-expense margin of about 14.1%-14.2%, about 50 basis points above our prior model and consensus. We have brought our model in line with guidance on these two items. Management reiterated fiscal 2017 SSS guidance of ""high single digits,"" 195-210 net new openings, and a 39% tax rate, each of which is in line with our model and consensus.

Note: we have made no changes to our SSS or unit growth forecasts.

2017-06-20,VZ,The Ad Maze (A Special Report) --- Race Is On to Challenge Digital 'Duopoly',"Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google tower so far above the rest of the digital advertising world that no company can claim the mantle of No. 3. But many are trying.

Snapchat parent Snap Inc. believes it has the young eyeballs advertisers crave. Amazon.com Inc., ever the disrupter, has the ability to upend the whole business with its extensive data. Verizon Communications Inc. is betting on its blend of web content, location data and ad technology following the purchases of AOL and Yahoo, while","AT&T Inc. thinks buying Time Warner Inc. will give it an edge.

With the exception of Chinese internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., which dominate their home market -- where their Western rivals are restricted -- none of the would-be challengers to the Google-Facebook ""duopoly"" even cracks a 3% share of global digital advertising.

Google and Facebook together collect nearly half of global spending. Last year, the U.S. online ad market expanded by nearly $12 billion and the two firms accounted for over 77% of that spending growth, according to eMarketer.

Advertisers are hoping for the emergence of a legitimate third player to provide competition that can give them more leverage and help keep prices in check. For ad agencies, the matter is existential: Google and Facebook have the resources to deploy entire teams to work with marketers directly, cutting out the middleman.

Wenda Harris Millard, vice chairman at advertising and media consulting firm MediaLink, said that to compete with Google and Facebook, other players will need to create premium content that appeals to advertisers or use new technologies that aren't yet mainstream.

""Maybe the third player competes on different grounds,"" Ms. Millard said.

Many ad executives believe Amazon, which has expanded successfully beyond its core retail business into areas like streaming video and artificial intelligence, has the greatest chance of taking on the ""duopoly.""

Amazon already allows marketers to place search ads on its website, as well as display ads on all its platforms. The company also built a tool that lets companies tap the e-commerce giant's data on its consumers' shopping habits in order to more efficiently place ads elsewhere on the web. And Amazon is helping publishers make more money from the ads on their sites with a so-called ""header bidding"" product that gives multiple buyers a chance to bid on their ads at the same time.

EMarketer predicts Amazon will generate $1.81 billion in ad revenue world-wide in 2017, a tiny fraction of Google's $74 billion. Amazon declined to comment.

""Amazon is going to be an increasingly important force and one we have to better understand and link with effectively for our clients,"" Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of ad holding giant WPP PLC said at the company's annual meeting earlier this month. He said the company was ""highly disruptive in many ways.""

On Amazon's first-quarter earnings call in April, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said the company was ""very happy"" with the growth of its ad business.

Snap is the newest contender for the third-place rosette. In 5 1/2 years, Snapchat has grown to 166 million active users -- a mere blip compared with Facebook's 1.24 billion daily active users, though the gap is much narrower in strong ad markets like the U.S. and Canada.

Snapchat's advantage is that its audience is mostly made up of the 18- to 34-year-old segment. On average, each Snapchatter spends more than 30 minutes daily in the app, giving advertisers lots of opportunities to target them. Snapchat has also brought on board several TV companies and publishers for the app's ""Discover"" section, offering marketers the opportunity to position their ads next to curated content.

Snap's ad business still has some catching up to do: Its average revenue per user in North America in its first quarter was $1.81, while Facebook clocked $16.56 per user in the U.S. and Canada.

Snap declined to comment.

Verizon also is emerging as a ""new"" player, having just merged AOL and Yahoo to form an advertising and content unit of the company called ""Oath.""

""There are only three companies in the world that touch one billion consumers digitally -- Facebook, Google, and Oath,"" said former AOL boss Tim Armstrong -- now the CEO of Oath -- in an interview.

Mr. Armstrong believes the company can expand its reach to two billion people world-wide and ratchet up revenue to between $10 billion and $20 billion by around 2020. The recipe: ad technology it has spent years investing in, location data and well-known web brands including HuffPost and Yahoo Sports.

He said rivals to Google and Facebook can zero in on ""white spaces"" with no dominant player: promoting brands instead of specific products, and using newer technologies such as augmented reality and virtual reality, for example.

Verizon's chief rival, AT&T, has its own lofty ambitions. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said at a conference in May that the Time Warner acquisition would create an entity that delivers nearly ""one trillion"" ad impressions a year. Mr. Stephenson said his company will be able to make money from Warner Bros. and Turner shows at a higher rate because it has data on AT&T subscribers' internet usage that can help marketers more accurately target their intended audiences.

For the foreseeable future, Madison Avenue will have to get used to dealing with two dominant players, a dynamic that isn't totally alien in the ad business.

""From a small-business perspective it's not much different than when Yellow Pages was the only game in town,"" said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Weiser. ""For large brands, it's not that different than the era where there were three [TV] networks.""

2017-06-20,MSCI,"3 Must Read Asia Market Stories: Crunch Time For MSCI on China, China Hits Peak Pork, and Aussie Banks In Spotlight After Moody's Downgrade -- Barron's Blog","Investors will learn overnight whether index compiler MSCI will include China A-shares in its closely followed indices.

Bloomberg has an interesting story looking at the decision and whether it really matters given traders are more focused on the rally on Wall Street and the gains made by U.S.-listed Chinese stocks. Here's some of the detail:","China's fourth attempt at cracking into MSCI Inc.'s benchmark share indexes comes with its best chance of success -- and the least at stake.

In what's become an annual event, MSCI will announce early Wednesday morning Hong Kong time whether China's domestic stocks have won inclusion. Previous efforts have foundered on concern over repatriation limits and excessive trading suspensions, obstacles the index compiler has sought to overcome with a less ambitious proposal.

While the decision still holds weight for investors, the swings of the nation's $6.8 trillion equity market are losing relevance for traders in London and New York more attuned to a global technology rally and signals from the Federal Reserve. Even if yuan-denominated shares are added, they would be dwarfed by overseas-listed Chinese stocks, which have an increasing sway over MSCI's developing nation gauge.

The Chinese love their pork but it looks like the world's most populous nation may have had its fill of the popular meat. Reuters has a great story about how the adoption of more healthy diet is affecting pork consumption growth. Here's a little taste:

For pig farmers in China and abroad, it is a difficult trend to stomach. The producers and other market experts had expected the growth to continue until at least 2026.

Chinese hog farmers are on a building spree, constructing huge modern farms to capture a bigger share of the world's biggest pork market, while leading producers overseas have been changing the way they raise their pigs to meet Chinese standards for imports. Some have, for example, stopped using growth hormones banned in China.

China still consumes a lot more meat than any other country. People here will eat about 74 million tonnes of pork, beef and poultry this year, around twice as much as the United States, according to U.S. agriculture department estimates. More than half of that is pork and for foreign producers it has been a big growth market, especially for Western-style packaged meats.

But pork demand has hit a ceiling, well ahead of most official forecasts. Sales of pork have now fallen for the past three years, according to data from research firm Euromonitor. Last year they hit three-year lows of 40.85 million tonnes from 42.49 million tonnes in 2014, and Euromonitor predicts they will also fall slightly in 2017.

Australian banks have been in the spotlight for a while given concerns about their exposure to frothy property prices in key markets like Sydney and Melbourne. The banks' asset quality will come under sharpened focus after Moody's Investors Service cut its ratings on the largest banks Down Under. Bloomberg has the details:

The decision by Moody's Investors Service to downgrade the ratings of Australia's largest banks has focused attention on the risks lurking in the country's A$1.51 trillion ($1.15 trillion) of mortgage loans.

""The resilience of household balance sheets and, consequently, bank portfolios to a serious economic downturn has not been tested at these levels of private sector indebtedness,"" Moody's said in the statement accompanying the downgrade of Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank Ltd. and Westpac Banking Corp.

The banks are already bracing themselves for an announcement in coming days from the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, which is due to say whether it will require the banks to hold more capital against their mortgage books as part of a wider update on capital requirements. Despite recent steps to rein in their exposure to the riskier areas of mortgage lending, the lenders still sit on by far the largest property lending books of any banks in the world, measured as a proportion of total loans.

2017-06-29,JPM,Fed 'Stress Tests' Clear All Banks to Issue Payouts to Shareholders -- Update,"Big U.S. banks won approval from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday to return money to shareholders, suggesting regulators believe they are healthy enough to stop stockpiling capital.

All 34 firms tested by the Federal Reserve got approval for their capital-return plans in the second part of the annual ""stress tests"" designed to gauge the soundness of the nation's financial system. The companies -- which include big banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co ., midsize lenders such as Regions Financial Corp . and credit-card companies including American Express Co . -- hold more than 75% of the total assets of U.S. financial companies.","Wednesday's results mark the first time since the annual tests began in 2011 that all firms passed. That reflects a turning point and could herald a return to precrisis days when banks were reliable dividend payers and shareholders flocked to them.

On average, the companies requested payouts that are near 100% of their expected earnings over the next year, up from 65% last year, senior Fed officials said.

That could provide a durable pillar of support for higher bank stock prices. Those soared following President Donald Trump 's victory but largely have treaded water so far in 2017 amid lackluster economic indicators and political defeats for the White House.

In after-hours trading Wednesday, following the stress-test results, several banks saw their shares increase by more than 1%, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc ., Morgan Stanley , Bank of America Corp ., J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc .

Analysts expect several banks, including Citigroup , to seek Fed approval to pay out more than they earn over the next year. Many banks will announce their new dividends and buyback targets Wednesday afternoon.

The results suggest that banks have gotten better at cracking the Fed's methodology, which executives have in the past described as a ""black box."" Morgan Stanley , Goldman Sachs and State Street Corp . came within tenths of a percentage point of falling below one of the Fed's minimum capital ratios.

Such signs indicate the industry is emboldened to seek higher payouts -- and that the Fed is inclined to approve them. That would reduce capital levels, which executives say have discouraged lending and crimped profitability.

""The absolute minimum is there won't be increased capital in these businesses,"" Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman said earlier this month. ""There shouldn't be and there won't be. Now it's a question of how quickly and how it gets peeled back.""

This is the second set of stress-test results released by the Fed over the past week, assessing whether officials believe the biggest banks could continue to lend even during a deep recession.

Last week, the largest U.S. banks breezed through the first round of tests with capital ratios well above the Fed's set minimum, when put through a hypothetical recession that included falling commercial real-estate prices, 10% unemployment and recessions in Europe and Japan.

""I'm pleased that the [stress-test] process has motivated all of the largest banks to achieve healthy capital levels and most to substantially improve their capital planning processes,"" Fed governor Jerome Powell said in a statement Wednesday.

The largest firms, however, ""continue to fall short of supervisory expectations"" in a few areas, including maintaining accurate data and identifying risks in new products or underwriting standards, the Fed's report said.

One worrisome spot is credit cards. Two of the largest stand-alone issuers, Capital One Financial Corp . and American Express , revised their payout requests downward after receiving the results of the stress test's first part last week.

American Express 's original request would have dropped it below one of the Fed's minimum capital ratios.

Capital One 's wouldn't have; it wasn't immediately clear why the firm took the so-called mulligan. The Fed approved Capital One 's plan, but only contingent on the firm resubmitting within six months to address what the regulator called ""material weaknesses.""

Credit-card defaults, which had fallen in recent years near record lows, are now on the rise, and were a central focus of the Fed officials in designing this year's stress tests. Last week's results forecast $100 billion in credit-card losses across big banks, making that category the worst-performing type of loan.

Born of the 2008 financial meltdown, the stress tests have come to command bankers' and investors' attention each year. Executives manage with the tests in mind and have collectively spent billions of dollars to develop risk-management systems to meet the Fed's expectations.

This year's passing grades suggest that those efforts have paid off. Banks today are better capitalized and more conservatively managed than in the years before the financial crisis, and have better insight into risks lurking in their own books.

In a nod to that progress, the Fed has made changes to the exams. This year, only 13 banks considered especially large and complex had to pass a qualitative exam of their risk-management abilities. Others faced only numerical assessments.

Some executives still say the Fed's process is too opaque and stringent and have complained that the higher capital required by them has choked lending and harmed the economy.

Mr. Gorman of Morgan Stanley , whose stress-test submission this year ran 44,999 pages, said recently that the Fed could make ""simple changes"" that ""could be very powerful for bank stocks.""

For example, the stress tests assume that, even in a severe downturn, banks would keep buying back stock at the same level they did in better times. For Morgan Stanley , that translates into nearly $8 billion in capital it must currently hold, about 11% of its total.

The Trump administration has been sympathetic to bankers' complaints and recently recommended additional changes to the tests, such as requiring capital-return approvals every other year rather than annually.

1856 ET [Dow Jones ] Grooming products retailer Shaver Shop (SSG.AU) is on course to beat a A$14.7M Ebitda forecast for FY17 outlined in its IPO prospectus a year ago, says Ord Minnett. And if it does then it owes a big thanks to Chinese consumers. Ord Minnett says positive sales trends experienced during March and April continued through May. ""It appears like-for-like sales growth has remained significantly elevated since the April update, supported by the recent surge in demand from the Chinese Daigou channel,"" it says. Daigou is a gray market that involves Chinese agents travelling to Australia, buying products, and then selling them in China on ecommerce platforms like Alibaba's (BABA) Taobao. Ord Minnett retains a buy call on Shaver Shop, citing an FY18 price-to-earnings ratio of 7.1 times and dividend yield of 7.1%. SSG last traded at A$0.595. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

1855 ET [Dow Jones ] Telecom company Megaport (MP1.AU) is raising equity at the right time, Canaccord Genuity says. On Wednesday, Megaport said it would raise A$27.8M by issuing shares to investors including Digital Realty (DLR). ""With A$12.4M cash on hand at the end of May and cash burn of approximately A$2M-A$2.5M per month, the time was evidently right to secure funding,"" says Canaccord. The raising means Megaport likely has enough cash for 18 months. Also, Canaccord views the addition of Digital Realty as ""a distinctly positive endorsement of Megaport's technology and its scalability."" Canaccord's price target moves up 14% to A$2.40, while it stays at hold. MP1 was at A$2.25 before trading in its shares were halted pending the raising. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)There is a planned settlement between Walgreens and Theranos that would bring a close to that partnership.

1832 ET - Morgan Stanley (MS) will boost its quarterly dividend from $0.20 to $0.25/share and repurchase up to $5 billion in stock over the next year.

MS is one of nine banks, out of 34 that underwent the stress tests, to crack the 100% payout ratio, per WSJ calculations. That means they are reducing, rather than adding, to their capital levels. The approval is a big win for MS, which has been under pressure from investors to boost returns.

Still, the analysts say they remain ""cyclically bullish within a structurally bearish framework,"" noting that global inventories are drawing, OPEC can still make deeper cuts, demand is high, and it's still possible U.S. producers will be deterred by rising costs.

1830 ET - Researchers in a citizen science project called ""Gravity Spy"" said that more than 8,500 children and adult volunteers have sifted through data looking for ""glitches,"" or transient noise, produced from Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors. LIGO data analysis helps in the discovery of black holes but the detectors are so sensitive that they pick up noises that are hard to separate from true gravitational-wave signals. In the ""Gravity Spy"" project, the wave data appears as pictures on a volunteer's computer screen. Volunteers then study the shapes and help determine if they should be classified as true signals or glitches. Researchers in many fields are increasingly turning to help from so-called citizen scientists in collecting or analyzing scientific data on a range of topics, including astronomy, protein folding, and bird sightings.

""That to us is the kind of anomaly that isn't likely to be permanent,"" he says. Triggering the correction is likely the passage of political risk in Washington this week giving ""investors a little bit of breathing space"" and bringing reflation back into play.

Analysts surveyed by the WSJ had anticipated stockpiles in the US at 4.83M tons but the USDA says it expects 5.5M tons. Futures fell on the news with the July contract down 1.1% on the day.

1208 ET - Brazilian consumer prices behaved better than expected in May, and the continuing improvement in the country's inflation outlook could lead financial markets to expect bigger rate cuts from the central bank going forward, according to economists at Sao Paulo-based Haitong Banco de Investimento do Brasil SA. Brazil's 12-month inflation rate fell to 3.6% in May, the country's statistics agency said Friday. The rapid decline in the 12-month rate leaves the door open for the central bank to continue its cycle of interest rate cuts, and could lead some analysts to lower their forecast for the year-end level of the bank's benchmark Selic rate, Haitong said. The central bank cut the Selic by a full percentage point last week to 10.25%. (jeffrey.lewis@wsj.com)

1203 ET - A senior Vanguard Group strategy executive is retiring, shifting oversight responsibilities for the firm's strategic planning and governance matters to other firm leaders. Glenn Reed, who joined the company a decade ago to oversee its finance units, will retire in late July. WSJ reported early last year that Reed's financial responsibilities were moved to a newly-hired executive. Now, Chris McIsaac, managing director of Vanguard's planning and development division, will take on Reed's strategy work and Anne Robinson, managing director, legal and compliance, will oversee the firm's investment stewardship group. Reed, 64, was an outside counsel to the fast-growing $4.3T money manager for 20 years before he was hired in 2007. He is a member of the firm's 12-person management team; a spokeswoman said after his departure that group will consist of 11 members. (sarah.krouse@wsj.com; @bysarahkrouse)

1150 ET - Digital Realty's (DLR) $5B offer for Dupont Fabros (DFT) sends DLR down a different path than the one it's mapped out for investors, adding more wholesale data center customers who rent space in bulk instead of retail buyers paying top dollar for smaller network gear deployments. But DLR says it can do both, highlighting DFT's marquee customers. They include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB), tech companies with a lot of bargaining power and voracious appetite for cloud computing resources. ""It's an affirmation of when you land a customer, particularly like some of these cloud providers, how they will expand and grow,"" DLR investment chief Scott Peterson says in an analyst conference call.

2017-06-02,COP,Paris Exit: Less Than Meets The Eye,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

Investors will feel the impact of the U.S.'s pullout from the Paris climate agreement in surprising and counterintuitive ways.","Energy giants Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, both of which supported the agreement, may get hit on the margin, even though the conventional wisdom has it that they would be winners.

Meanwhile, future greenhouse gas emissions may not be too different from what they might have been under a Clinton administration. Market forces, such as cheap natural gas, will have a bigger effect than the agreement would have.

Meanwhile, U.S. regulations aimed at meeting Paris goals weren't burdensome for all. Exxon Mobil, for example, stood to benefit. Stricter U.S. climate rules may have produced a slight drag on the demand for oil, a global commodity of which Exxon is the sixth-largest producer. But it would have been a boon to U.S. natural gas, a mostly landlocked market where Exxon is the top producer.

Furthermore, rules mandating the capture of greenhouse gas methane, which escapes some U.S. oil wells, hurts smaller competitors far more than Exxon or its peers. Big oil's wells are in large fields near pipelines where the methane already can be captured and turned into fuels.

Finally, Exxon shareholders, a majority of whom voted this week on a nonbinding proposal calling for it to reveal the impact of complying with climate-change rules, might have been placated.

The trajectory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions under President Donald Trump's policies may be surprisingly mild.

Under the auspices of the Paris agreement, the Obama administration pledged to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to between 26% and 28% below the 2005 level by 2025. Much of that already is well under way, though, as a result of factors outside of any president's control: slower growth following the financial crisis, the shale gas revolution that has replaced a third of coal use and shifting driving habits.

The Rhodium Group calculates that the U.S. still will come close to a 17% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions as soon as 2020 but then stall.

Other policies will do relatively little to meet climate goals. For example, state and federal tax breaks encourage electric-vehicle sales, but they are just 1% of all passenger vehicles sold today. Even if they reach 5% of all vehicles on the road by 2025, the reduction in total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions would be about half a percentage point, holding all else equal.

Other Obama policies may not have been as effective as they seemed. Natural gas should continue to replace older coal plants as long as the relative prices of the fuels remain around today's levels, though perhaps more slowly than before. And auto makers would likely have negotiated loopholes in efficiency rules.

There is little doubt that some U.S. industries can celebrate, but governments around the world, and even in some U.S. states, may force U.S. companies to adhere to stricter rules anyway.

The initial $9.4B deal had Walgreens (WBA) paying roughly $2.6M per store once the two companies offloaded 865 locations to a regional chain.

The private-equity firm plans to split SPLS into three separately financed entities, The Journal reported on Thursday. When Sycamore bought beleaguered retailer Jones Group in 2014, it split the company into six separately financed entities which made it easier to facilitate the sales of two of them: Kurt Geiger and Stuart Weitzman.

A big weight on major indexes today: declines in tech stocks. The group, down 1.8% in the S&P 500 and resuming a recent spurt of weakness, is offsetting gains in financial shares, which rallied earlier after the Federal Reserve approved bigger dividend payouts and share buybacks.

Both chains face withering in-store sales, but their merger attempt last year ended amid fears over higher prices for business-to-business deliveries, not in retail. A clean break could let bankers glue together SPLS and ODP's retail operations, removing at least one competitor on the strip-mall scene.

Improved Results

Foot Locker Inc. reported a rise in fourth-quarter profit and revenue amid a slowdown in the retail industry.

Same-store sales at the sports-apparel retailer topped expectations, growing 5%. Analysts had projected a 4.6% increase.

The athletic store's performance recently has been helped by trendy sneakers that have customers buying shoes for fashion rather than competition, even as shoppers have skipped many other mall-based stores.

In all, Foot Locker reported a profit of $189 million, or $1.42 a share, up from $158 million, or $1.14, a year earlier.

Revenue increased 5.3% to $2.11 billion.

DIGITALGLOBE

Firm Finds Buyer

In $2.11 Billion Deal

Canadian satellite company MacDonald Dettwiler & Associates said it reached a deal to buy DigitalGlobe Inc. in a cash-and-stock deal. Colorado-based DigitalGlobe has commercial satellites in orbit that allow it to provide imaging services to the defense community and others.

Each DigitalGlobe share will be exchanged for $17.50 in cash and 0.3132 shares of MacDonald Dettwiler. Based on the closing price of MacDonald Dettwiler shares Thursday, the deal had a value of about $2.11 billion.

MacDonald Dettwiler said the deal was worth more before Feb. 17, when The Wall Street Journal reported on the talks. MacDonald Dettwiler said the deal represents a 18% premium to DigitalGlobe's closing stock price in New York on Feb. 16.

2017-02-02,INVH,IPOs: Muted Welcome For IPO Of Big Landlord,"Invitation Homes Inc. shares ended flat in their market debut Wednesday, as owner Blackstone Group LP takes a step toward cashing in its big bet on housing.

Shares of the real-estate investment trust opened at $20.10, above the initial-public-offering price of $20, and traded in a narrow range of $19.80 to $20.42 during the session. The stock ended the day unchanged at $20, giving the company a market value of more than $6 billion, according to securities filings.","On Tuesday, Invitation Homes raised $1.54 billion in its initial public offering, which represents the largest U.S.-listed IPO in more than a year. The real-estate investment trust sold 77 million shares at $20 apiece.

Invitation Homes is the end result of the biggest homebuying spree in history. Starting in 2012 with a home in Phoenix, Blackstone spent some $10 billion buying and fixing up homes to rent. For stretches, the private-equity giant spent $150 million a week on foreclosed homes, often buying them sight unseen.

The company now owns and rents 48,431 houses in 13 markets, from Seattle to south Florida, according to Invitation's offering document. Blackstone Group didn't plan to sell any of its roughly 70% stake in the IPO, the filing said, but the listing will enable it to begin cashing out of its investment in the future.

The IPO is also a test of investors' interest in the rental-home business. Invitation is part of a broader bet on Wall Street that homeownership will remain out of reach for many Americans. Invitation will join its two largest rental-home rivals on the stock market. Shares of American Homes 4 Rent and Colony Starwood Homes made their debuts in recent years to tepid demand but surged last year as the homeownership rate fell to its lowest level in at least 50 years, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.

Homeownership has declined since the housing crisis amid stricter lending standards, mounting student debt and potential buyers whose savings and credit diminished during the recession. But some investors have questioned whether the growth of Invitation and its rivals will be limited now that the foreclosure crisis is over and home prices in many markets have exceeded their 2006 highs.

Last week, Invitation won an important endorsement from Fannie Mae, when the government-controlled mortgage-finance company said it would guarantee as much as $1 billion of the company's debt, a development that will likely mean cheaper borrowing costs for Invitation and potentially its rivals.",442,article,",c1711,c14,neqac,c02,c17,c171,cactio,ccat,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,"

2017-02-06,RL,Business News: Tiffany CEO Will Exit as Sales Slip,"Tiffany & Co. on Sunday said Chief Executive Frederic Cumenal is stepping down and the luxury jeweler is starting a search for a new leader to reverse a prolonged sales slump.

The New York-based company said Mr. Cumenal, who has run Tiffany for the past two years, will be succeeded, effective immediately, by his predecessor, company Chairman Michael Kowalski.","Tiffany said its board is ""committed to our current core business strategies, but has been disappointed by recent financial results."" The company reiterated its recent financial forecasts and said it needed to accelerate its execution to improve its performance.

Shares of Tiffany, which have underperformed the broader market, closed Friday at $80.47, little changed from when Mr. Cumenal took the helm.

The luxury brand has posted declining same-store sales for several quarters, hurt by diminished spending by foreign tourists as the stronger dollar has made such shopping trips more expensive.

Last month, the company reported a 4% drop in North American same-store sales for the holidays, which it blamed on lower foot traffic to its flagship Fifth Avenue store. The company highlighted traffic disruptions and security around its neighbor, Trump Tower, where the new president was meeting with various leaders.

Mr. Cumenal said he didn't expect a material improvement in the macroeconomic challenges the company faced in 2016. The company's revenue has been flat at about $4 billion since 2014.

Tiffany is the latest luxury company to undergo an executive shake-up, underscoring the pressure on established brands to reinvent themselves for a fast-changing market, where social media allows upstarts to quickly gain a footing and consumers are no longer loyal. Last week, Ralph Lauren Corp. said its chief executive, Stefan Larsson, will leave the company in May after less than two years on the job due to creative differences with the company's founder.

Mr. Cumenal joined Tiffany in 2011 to oversee sales and distribution, and was appointed president and joined the board in 2013. The Frenchman was hired from LVMH, where he had been CEO of Moet & Chandon SA.

Mr. Kowalski, who joined the company in 1983, was the CEO of Tiffany from 1999 until he handed over the top spot to Mr. Cumenal in April 2015.",389,article,",c1513,c411,neqac,cslmc,c15,c151,c41,ccat,ncat,nfact,nfcpex,nfcpin,"

While major indexes are bumping up against all-time highs, Abrahams writes that the same can't be said for all stocks, including some that he has a Buy rating on.","He highlights stocks that sold off after earnings on what he believes are temporary issues, creating a good buying opportunity. His list is: Ball Corp. ( BLL), Booz Allen Hamilton ( BAH), CA, Inc. ( CA), Chevron ( CVX), Freeport-McMoRan ( FCX), Gilead Sciences ( GILD), International Paper ( IP), Mattel ( MAT), Newell Brands ( NWL), and T. Rowe Price ( TROW), all of which have Buy ratings from his firm.

More from his note:

While investors may have sold these stocks because of what happened at the end of 2016, several of the stocks that have been identified are likely to benefit in the future from tax reform, according to Jefferies analysts, even if there's a Border Adjusted Tax. Beneficiaries of tax reform include Booz Allen Hamilton, CA, Inc., International Paper, and T. Rowe Price. Gilead already has a low tax rate, but the company would benefit from a lower tax rate on repatriated cash, with 80% of the company's cash held overseas.

That said, he notes that while not all stocks may benefit from tax reform, which remains uncertain, all do look like they've sold off too far since earnings.

2017-02-09,WYNN,"MGM Earnings: 36% Upside On Vegas & Macau, JPM Says -- Barron's Blog","MGM Resorts International ( MGM) is to report fourth-quarter earnings Feb. 16 and J.P. Morgan expects reinforcement that MGM is the best risk-reward among casino stocks.

JPM analysts Joseph Greff, Daniel Politzer, Nicholas Leibold and Brandt Montour, who have an overweight rating on the stock, expect fourth quarter net revenue from the Las Vegas strip to rise 4% year on year and a 2% decline in Macau. But they expect adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) to rise 13% overall, with a rise of 13% in Vegas and 11% in Macau, after royalties. They have a $39 price target on the stock, implying upside of 36%. Two excerpts from their earnings preview report:",""" ... We continue to believe that MGM possesses the best risk-reward in gaming, with 65% of its cash flows coming from the Las Vegas Strip (and only 10% exposure to Macau), a market with no new supply growth and group/convention momentum, which should allow it to garner continued attractive (and above U.S. lodging industry) overall room pricing and non-gaming, out of the room spend growth aided by incremental EBITDA coming from the T-Mobile Arena and Park related investments ...

Our 4Q Macau property level EBITDA estimate could be somewhat aggressive (J.P. Morgan estimate: $145 million versus consensus $133 million) given our interpretation of Wynn Resorts ( WYNN) GGR [gross gaming revenue] share gains, but given that Macau is just 9% of MGM's adjusted EBITDA and dependent on its one property in Macau, we think investor expectations seem set appropriately low ...""

Wells Fargo analysts are neutral on the Macau gaming group including MGM, 


Wynn,  Las Vegas Sands ( LVS) and   Melco Crown Entertainment ( MPEL). For more, see our posts Macau Earnings: Neutral Despite Rooster Crow From China? and Macau Weighs On Las Vegas Sands Q4 Earnings.

2017-04-25,NOC,Business News: 5 Things to Watch In Defense Earnings,"The largest U.S. defense companies report first-quarter earnings this week. Here are some things to look for.

-- Lockheed Kicks Off","Lockheed Martin Corp., the world's largest defense contractor by sales, opens the reporting season before the bell Tuesday. Investors' focus remains on the planned rise in F-35 combat jet production and Lockheed's efforts to boost the profitability of the plane while reducing its cost following White House intervention.

-- Budget Black Hole

Defense companies are working in the dark. A temporary budget runs out Friday and will likely be replaced by another that freezes spending at prior-year levels for several months, assuming a government shutdown is avoided.

-- Cheaper by the Dozen

The number of big contracts being awarded has shrunk as budgets tightened, but companies are also becoming pickier. Northrop Grumman Corp., which reports Wednesday, pulled out of the contest to build new Air Force trainers, and, like others, is guarded about the Pentagon procurement apparatus.

-- Something's Got to Give

General Dynamics Corp., which reports Wednesday, has been by far the best-performing defense firm since the presidential election, boosted by rhetoric around expanding the Navy and a slightly brighter outlook for its Gulfstream business jets.

-- Export Potential

Congress was notified of overseas defense deals valued at $62.5 billion last year. High-end equipment such as the missile-defense systems made by Raytheon Co., which reports Thursday, as well as combat jets and munitions, remain in heavy demand.",257,article,",c151,neqac,c15,ccat,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,"

April 22, 2017 03:57 ET (07:57 GMT)",755,article,",c181,ceqpm,cgvfil,neqac,c18,cactio,ccat,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,"
2017-04-03,ROST,Heard on the Street: New Retail Fashion: Consistency -- WSJ,"Most investors will pay a premium for growth. In the volatile world of retail stocks, many are increasingly willing to pay up for consistency too.

Before their 23% tumble last Thursday on downbeat guidance, shares of Lululemon Athletica fetched 26 times forward earnings estimates. That reflected expectations that sales would climb an impressive 16% this fiscal year. Now the athletic-wear maker's sales are only expected to grow 9%, yet its multiple still stands at 22 times. For a similar multiple of 21 times investors could have owned shares of off-price retailer Ross Stores. Its sales are only expected to climb 7%, but there is little risk to it achieving that. In an already turbulent industry now being transformed by the internet, investors increasingly covet retailers that can produce consistent results and are willing to pay a premium for them. They are also less likely to abandon these bastions of relative safety than other retailers' shares.","""You're not looking at the multiple like you used to,"" said Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel. ""You are looking for the peace of mind that comes with not having to worry about a double-digit decline.""

Among those that Mr. Siegel puts in that camp are Ross and its off-price rival TJX Cos., as well as home improvement stores Home Depot and Lowe's. Apart from Lowe's, all trade at 20 times or higher, despite expected sales growth of only 5% to 7%.

Ross and TJX have benefited from the weakness at department stores, which has given them access to higher quality merchandise. The retailers' constantly changing assortment, which shoppers dig through to find gems, also helps them avoid margin eroding e-commerce sales. While both companies' shares have underperformed the S&P 500 over the past year, they have more than doubled over the past five. Neither has reported a quarterly same-store sales decline since the end of fiscal 2009.

The story is similar for Home Depot and Lowe's which sell goods that often require a trip to a store, making them more immune than most retailers to competition from Amazon.com. Home Depot's shares have nearly tripled over the past five years, while Lowe's shares have more than doubled. Home Depot hasn't had a same-store sales decline in more than six years and Lowe's' hasn't for over three.

Investors are growing fonder of consistency. Forward multiples for Ross, TJX and Home Depot are well above their five-year averages and have been so for much of the past two years. Lowe's, where performance has lagged behind a bit, trades just below its five-year average. This premium versus the rest of retail could widen as the movement of sales online continue to take their course.

For jittery retail investors, these steady stocks may be a panacea.

2017-04-26,BIIB,"Nasdaq Tops 6000 for First Time --- Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet contribute 41% of 2017 gain","The Nasdaq Composite Index raced past 6000, the latest sign that technology companies have become a driving force in the recent stock-market rally.

The index hit the milestone 17 years after it reached 5000 during the dot-com era, in a broad rally Tuesday that was turbocharged by earnings from bellwether companies including Caterpillar Inc., McDonald's Corp. and biotechnology giant Biogen Inc. The Nasdaq climbed 41.67 points, or 0.7%, to 6025.49.","Surging technology shares have helped the index outperform its peers so far this year. The top five contributors to the Nasdaq's 2017 gains -- Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. -- account for 41% of the index's advance, according to stock-market research firm Birinyi Associates.

Such gains have partly come at the expense of the bank and industrial shares that powered the postelection rally. Tech stocks have become a way to bet on U.S. economic growth while reducing reliance on anticipated U.S. policy changes like tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure spending, many investors and analysts say.

Technology shares in the S&P 500 have risen roughly 14% so far this year, compared with 2.5% for financials and 6.7% for the broader S&P 500. The Nasdaq Composite is up 12% year to date.

Fund managers bumped up overweight positions in the tech sector to the second-highest level in Bank of America Merrill Lynch data going back to 2008, the bank said in March.

""If the economy is going to heat up, you want to be in an area that can keep up,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist and senior portfolio manager at Boston Private Wealth.

Tech companies in the S&P 500 are on track to post 14% growth in earnings for the first quarter from the year-earlier period, according to reported results and analyst estimates on FactSet, compared with the 10% growth rate expected for the broader S&P 500.

Apple shares have risen 25% for the year on signs of renewed momentum at the firm. Apple in May is expected to report quarterly earnings of $2.02 a share, according to FactSet, up from $1.90 a share a year earlier.

Class A shares of Facebook have gained 27% in 2017, with analysts estimating the company will report quarterly earnings of $1.12 a share in May, according to FactSet, supported by data pointing to sustained growth in its advertising revenue. The firm had reported earnings of 52 cents a share a year earlier.

Amazon, Google's Alphabet and Intel Corp. are scheduled to report results on Thursday.",455,article,",m11,c151,neqac,nsmcm,c15,ccat,mcat,ncat,nfact,nfce,nfcpin,"
2017-09-12,NDAQ,SES Contract Promotes Boeing Satellite Transformation -- Market Talk,"1645 ET - Winning the contract to build seven highly-flexible communications satellites for European operator SES is expected to provide a boost for Boeing's (BA) long-term efforts to transform the way it manufacturers such spacecraft. The new business buttresses BA's overall drive to switch to smaller, easily reprogrammable satellites for various customers. With other satellite operators eyeing new designs, BA has been looking at more modular assemblies and streamlined testing procedures. The goal is partly to get an edge on US and European satellite-making rivals. (andy.pasztor@wsj.com)","1625 ET - The quality of the US corn crop, beset by early weather troubles, held steady last week as farmers in the western Corn Belt began harvesting. The USDA says 61% of the crop was in good-or-excellent condition as of Sunday, unchanged from a week earlier. Farmers have collected 5% of the crop, with the most rapid progress in Texas and Nebraska. The share of good-or-excellent soybeans, meanwhile, dipped to 60% from 61% a week earlier. That the quality of both crops is largely steady adds to the mounting evidence that the US is on track for another large harvest this season. (benjamin.parkin@wsj.com; @b_parkyn)

1618 ET - Though the poultry industry for years has sought to run its processing lines faster than the USDA currently allows, it would likely take time for it to ramp up if the current cap is raised. Sanderson Farms (SAFM) CEO Joe Sanderson told investors on a conference call in May that chicken companies would first need to build up their breeder flocks to supply enough birds to fulfill the additional processing capacity, while also adding hatchery space and modifying plant operations to accommodate the faster speeds. ""It would take a year to do that,"" Sanderson said at the time. (jacob.bunge@wsj.com; @jacobbunge)

1605 ET - US stocks post strong gains and the S&P 500 closes at an all-time high as worries over North Korea and Hurricane Irma lessen. The Dow rises 1.2% to 22057, the S&P gains 1.1% to 2488 and the Nasdaq adds 1.1% to 6432. Financials top the S&P and insurers lead that sector higher as hurricane-battered stocks XL Group and Everest Re rebound as Irma's intensity fades and worst case scenarios didn't come to pass, gaining 5% and 4.3% respectively. Only telecom was lower, with CenturyLink down 1.1%. Equifax was by far the hardest-hit S&P company, down 8.2% as it continues to plummet after announcing it was hacked. Haven assets pull back with gold 1.5% lower at $1331 and 10-year Treasury yields rising to 2.131%. Oil rises 1.2% to $48.04. The WSJ Dollar Index jumps 0.7% as investors load up on dollars ahead of US economic data later this week. (jonathan.vuocolo@wsj.com; @jonvuocolo)

1547 ET - Bank of Canada issues comments taking issue with an assessment that it dropped the ball in telegraphing its outlook ahead of last week's decision to increase the policy rate. BMO Capital Markets' chief economist said there was an ""epic fail"" when it came to BoC communications before the Sept. 6 rate decision, and that's partly why C$ and Canada bond yields shot up dramatically. In contrast, the Federal Reserve goes to great lengths to address markets beforehand. BoC, through a spokesman, says traders had priced in ""roughly 50-50 odds of an increase,"" prior to the announcement, versus the majority of economists who predicted no change. ""A much higher percentage of trading desks were correctly interpreting the bank's prior messaging that monetary policy would be forward-looking and data dependent, not predetermined.""

1543 ET - No 2 US chicken processor Pilgrim's Pride (PPC), majority owned by embattled Brazilian meatpacker JBS SA, agreed to buy European meat company Moy Park from JBS for $1B in a neat trick of portfolio management for JBS. Vertical Group analysts generally like the strategic aspects of the deal -- namely boosting Pilgrim's sales from higher-margin prepared foods -- but say it adds more uncertainties for previously North America-focused Pilgrim's. Retail is even more competitive in Europe than the US, Vertical says, and along with new regulatory and currency risks, animal production and processing tends to be more heavily regulated there. PPC falls 3.1%. (jacob.bunge@wsj.com; @jacobbunge)

1538 ET - Boeing (BA) takes its satellite order tally for 2017 to eight with the latest order for seven from Luxembourg-based SES, surpassing its tally for the previous three years combined. BA managed four orders last year, two in 2015 and one the previous year. The latest $1B deal for medium-earth-orbit satellites highlights the lack of commercial opportunities even as the industry touts the emergence of nanosats which can be launched and deployed by the hundred.

1513 ET - Hurricane Irma has shut down CSX headquarters in downtown Jacksonville, a spokesman for the railway says, and it will remain closed through Tuesday. Local authorities recommended businesses adjacent to waterways close, and the building is near the St. Johns River. Other area facilities remain open. CSX stopped shipments to parts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina last week and will start those back up once conditions allow. (paul.ziobro@wsj.com; @pziobro)

1452 ET - The travel unit of UK-based Allianz Insurance PLC says it is handling around 5,500 claims from customers whose trips were delayed or cancelled from Hurricanes Irma and Harvey.

1445 ET - Capital One chief executive Richard Fairbank said at the Barclays financial services conference that the Equifax breach is ""going to be costly"" to the bank, citing costs that will likely be associated with servicing, customer service calls and reissuing credit cards.

1443 ET - Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) CEO Meg Whitman has joined the board of directors at Dropbox, a highly-valued privately-held Silicon Valley startup that began as online storage for documents and photos. Dropbox is now worth an estimated $10B and is said to be eyeing an initial public offering later this year. The company has raised an eye-popping $607M in equity funding. Whitman is no stranger to the needs of tech startups going public. She joined EBAY in 1998 when it had just 30 employees and revenues of about $4M, and shepherded the company through an IPO in 2002. She ultimately helped build the company to $8B in annual revenue by 2008, the year she left EBAY. (rachael.king@wsj.com; @sfwriter)

2017-09-20,PGR,Banking & Finance: Progressive Is Hard Hit as Hurricane Triples Losses From Catastrophes,"Progressive Corp. swung to a loss in August, the company reported Tuesday, with Hurricane Harvey more than tripling the insurer's catastrophe losses in the period compared with last year.

Progressive said more than 90% of total catastrophe losses in August were linked to Harvey, the first substantial hurricane to hit Texas since Hurricane Ike struck the Gulf Coast in 2008.","Last month, the company sustained $254 million in catastrophe losses, up from about $75 million during August 2016. A vast majority of the losses were tied to Progressive's vehicle business, with only $26 million involving the property segment.

For the month, the company swung to a loss of $16.8 million from a profit of $49.3 million last year. Net premiums written during the month, meanwhile, rose 15.8% to $2.21 billion.

Hurricane Harvey pounded Texas last month with torrential rain, high winds and widespread flooding. The last Category 4 storm to hit Texas was Hurricane Carla in 1961, according to the National Weather Service.

While the insurance industry is strong overall, insurers with large Texas operations are vulnerable.

Insurers have braced for hundreds of thousands of claims from homeowners, car owners and businesses.

The top homeowners' insurers in Texas are State Farm, Allstate Corp. and Farmers Insurance, according to ratings agency A.M. Best.

2017-09-20,DPZ,Mountain Of Debt Felled Toys 'R' Us,"Competition may have brought down Toys ""R"" Us Inc. But the debt that three Wall Street firms heaped on the company when they took it private -- and the way the ownership group was constructed -- left the retailer without a fighting chance.","When a consortium comprised of Vornado Realty Trust and private-equity firms KKR & Co. and Bain Capital bought the toy retailer for $6.6 billion in 2005, it was already struggling against competition from discounters including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp., and the threat of online competition from the rapidly growing Amazon.com Inc. loomed. Still, Toys ""R"" Us had valuable real estate and the investors planned to boost the company's sales and financial performance, banking in part on the strength of its name.

A dozen years later, Toys ""R"" Us has filed for bankruptcy protection, seeking relief from creditors in a Virginia court late Monday in a move that will all but wipe out the owners' $1.4 billion of equity. The company has $5.3 billion in debt, unchanged from when it went private.

Vornado has marked down the value of its stake in Toys ""R"" Us to zero, according to the real estate firm's annual securities filing. KKR and Bain have similarly marked down their investments, according to people familiar with the matter. The owners didn't pay themselves any dividends and though they have been drawing advisory fees, the amounts represent a small fraction of their overall losses.

As in virtually all private-equity deals, the original purchase was funded with significant debt.

Paying back that debt has cost Toys ""R"" Us dearly, with nearly $6 billion in total interest payments, including a combined $910 million in 2016 and 2017. And the company hasn't made progress reining in its heavy debt load during its 12 years under private ownership, as virtually all excess cash was earmarked for reinvestment. At the end of the quarter after the deal's close, the retailer's net debt was 7.2 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. As of the end of this year's first quarter, the leverage ratio stood at 7.8 times.

""The $400 million a year in debt service was really constrictive as they were trying to compete,"" said Katherine Waldock, a finance professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business.

Chief Executive David Brandon said in court papers Tuesday that Toys ""R"" Us has been hampered by its ""significant leverage,"" and the result is ""the company has fallen behind some of its primary competitors on various fronts, including with regard to general upkeep and the condition of our stores, our inability to provide expedited shipping options, and our lack of a subscription-based delivery service.""

The deal recalls a time when doing buyouts with multiple partners was popular because it opened up a wider array of big targets. These so-called club deals have fallen out of favor in recent years as limited partners who were often invested in more than one buyer's funds pushed back. That has helped shrink the size of private-equity deals.

Club deals also created a challenge when it came to managing companies.

At Toys ""R"" Us, differences emerged among the three owners over whether to manage the company for growth. As a real-estate investment trust, Vornado was more focused on the retailer's asset value and on profiting from its real estate.

""At Toys, we invested in a club with two renowned private-equity firms who are focused on improving operations and growing earnings,"" Vornado Chief Executive Steven Roth wrote in an April 2015 letter to investors. ""Our suggestions of realizing value through real estate played second fiddle.""

While some unprofitable stores were sold, Gerald Storch, who was CEO in the early stages of the buyout, led a push to combine the Toys ""R"" Us and Babies ""R"" Us brands under the same roofs and remodel the stores. The company beefed up its marketing and began selling online through its own websites.

The new superstores got high marks from consumers and helped Toys ""R"" Us post stronger sales, but the retailer's heavy debt load meant it was only able to convert 146 of its more than 1,500 stores to the new format by the time it filed for an initial public offering in 2010. E-commerce accounted for only $602 million of its $13.57 billion in sales in fiscal 2009.

But five years had passed since the takeover and private-equity firms typically get itchy for an exit around then. The idea was to time the IPO for after the holiday selling season when Toys ""R"" Us gets the bulk of its profits, according to a person familiar with the matter. But results in the quarter suffered as discounters stepped up their promotional efforts and the company put off the IPO, later pulling the planned offering altogether.

Mr. Storch stepped down as chief executive in 2013 after Toys ""R"" Us reported more disappointing holiday results, ceding the role to longtime company executive Antonio Urcelay. Mr. Urcelay, who began as an interim CEO and was later appointed to the role on a permanent basis, put in place a plan that emphasized retailing basics like keeping the right goods in stock and discounting less.

Meanwhile, competition in the baby business had intensified as rivals such as Bed Bath and Beyond Inc.'s Buy Buy Baby added locations and as Amazon pushed deeper into the category following its acquisition of Diapers.com. Margins for Babies ""R"" Us, which had looked like the stronger part of Toys ""R"" Us at the time of the leveraged buyout, began to get squeezed.

By the time Mr. Brandon, a veteran of Domino's Pizza and Valassis Communications Inc., took over the top spot after Mr. Urcelay retired in 2015, the company was primarily focused on maximizing cash flow, according to a person familiar with the matter.

One strategy Toys ""R"" Us could have pursued after it pulled the IPO was to carve off and sell its businesses in Canada, Japan, Europe and China -- markets where the competitive dynamics were better than in the U.S. But the owners believed the process of separating these businesses would be too complicated and decided against such a move, according to people familiar with the matter.

Toys ""R"" Us has lined up a $3.1 billion bankruptcy loan, and received court approval Tuesday to begin using roughly $1 billion toward servicing its bank debt, paying vendors to keep shipments coming, and paying employees.

The company's attorneys said Tuesday this bankruptcy loan is vital to allowing Toys ""R"" Us to buy inventory for the crucial holiday season.

""I don't view this necessarily as a doomsday,"" said Louis Cisz, a bankruptcy and restructuring attorney at Nixon Peabody LLP, which isn't involved with the restructuring.

""There's no immediate plan to close stores. They're going to pay vendors in order to build up inventory. Those are positive signs under the circumstances.""

Canada has said it's reviewing the potential purchase of 18 BA F/A-18 Super Hornet jets after the Commerce Department launched a probe into alleged subsidies and unfair discounts of passenger jets made by Bombardier. That probe was triggered by a BA complaint.

Eric Greitens. The summary adds Trudeau mentioned the jobs at stake in Missouri from production of the Super Hornet.

Kansas doesn't rank among the top 30 chicken-producing states and nearby Missouri is ninth, well behind the poultry powerhouses of the US south. TSN aims to sign up farmers who will invest in chicken barns to raise birds supplied by the company, and its feed mill will become a big buyer of crops from local farmers, adding a source of demand for farmers and competition for local grain companies and cattle ranches. TSN estimates the plant will generate a $150M annual economic benefit to Kansas. (jacob.bunge@wsj.com; @jacobbunge)

1037 ET - A record-high level of jobs openings might overstate tightness in the labor market. There were 6.17 million job openings at the end of July, setting another record high, Labor Department says. Openings have increased by nearly 200,000 from a year earlier. That could suggest employers are struggling to find qualified employees. It's also possible that firms aren't terribly motivated to fill all their openings, and instead are using internet posting to fish for perfect candidates. If the labor market were as tight as the openings figure suggests, wages would likely be rising faster than the 2.5% pace essentially held since late 2015. (eric.morath@wsj.com; @ericmorath)

1110 ET - A monthly gauge of rural economy health falls to its lowest point for the year, reflecting ongoing trouble in the US Farm Belt. The index, drawn from a survey of farm bankers in 10 states by Creighton University, in September fell to 39.6, the lowest level since December. Creighton says Midwestern lenders remain pessimistic about the farm economy thanks to concerns over low commodity prices, trade and a drought that struck parts of the Farm Belt this year. About 51% of bankers reported restructuring loans to farmers, according to Creighton, while nearly 19% say they've increased collateral requirements. Still, farm-loan defaults rise just 2.1% over the past year and delinquencies 4.1%. One Illinois banker says early harvest results indicate the state's crop will be 15% to 20% smaller than last year.

2017-05-26,SCHW,The Quants: BlackRock Uses Big Data to Deploy Ads --- New system uses algorithms to put online ads in front of most likely customers,"[Machines and their masters are the undisputed new kings of Wall Street]

At the exact moment a mom-and-pop investor considers buying bank stocks, an advertisement pops up on their desktop promoting a financials-focused fund.","The scenario isn't science fiction; it is BlackRock Inc.'s latest business plan.

The world's largest money manager with $5.4 trillion under management is developing a new advertising system that uses sentiment analysis from messages on Twitter Inc. and other data to help determine when to advertise specific funds in its vast lineup of exchange-traded funds.

The effort, a partnership with advertising firm WPP PLC, is the latest example of fund firms experimenting with new ways to attract cash in an increasingly competitive market for low-cost index-tracking funds. It shifts the use of computer programs beyond investing to using algorithms to woo retail investors.

""The same value we get on the investing side from big data and algorithms and looking at trends and responding to them -- we'd like to do that on the advertising side,"" said Jennifer Grancio, head of global business development at BlackRock's iShares ETF business.

BlackRock competes with rivals including Vanguard Group, State Street Corp., Invesco Ltd. and Charles Schwab Corp. for investor cash in the $2.8 trillion U.S. ETF market.

The financial-services industry spent $2.5 billion on automated online-ad buying and selling in 2016, according to estimates from market research firm eMarketer.

Algorithms have been a part of the digital ad-buying process for years, where ad space is traded on exchanges like stocks in financial markets. But BlackRock and WPP are now trying to apply quantitative strategies to determine when to ramp up buying. These algorithms even adjust how much money the firm is spending on such ads.

ETFs have become the epicenter of growth in the asset-management industry, attracting hundreds of billions in new investor money in recent years. They have tax advantages over mutual funds and trade on exchanges like stocks. Money managers have raced to one up each other on product launches and ultralow fees.

BlackRock, which has cut prices aggressively for some products, also is trying to respond faster to economic and political changes that shape investor decisions. To do so, the firm is relying on social-media sentiment data and analysis of news stories to determine which ETF ads to display.

Ahead of the U.K.'s vote last year to leave the European Union, BlackRock advertised its iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF, an unhedged ETF that invests in U.K. stocks. It quickly opted to switch the ads to a hedged version of the fund after U.K.'s surprising decision to leave the EU.

But the money manager wants to do more and at a faster pace while staying ahead of rivals. BlackRock is using analysis from firms such as iSentium LLC to start ramping up or scaling back targeted ads in sync with investor sentiment.

Such efforts bring distinct challenges. Hagan Major, co-founder of ad firm Yellowhammer Media Group, said asset managers face a balancing act in pushing targeted ads about financial decisions without encroaching on the privacy of clients.

""There's a very fine line between really effective and really creative and something that feels invasive for a consumer,"" he said.",582,article,",c32,cdatam,c181,neqac,c18,c31,cactio,ccat,cknowm,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,"

Retailer Hires","Finance Chief

Nordstrom Inc. has hired Anne Bramman as chief financial officer, filling a role that was vacated when its former CFO retired earlier this month.

Ms. Bramman, 49 years old, announced her resignation from Avery Dennison Corp., a maker of adhesive technologies and packaging materials, in March after two years on the job.

Nordstrom's former CFO, Mike Koppel, retired May 1 after 16 years with the company. He will continue to serve as an adviser through the end of the year.

Like other retailers, Nordstrom has been struggling to adapt to changing consumer behavior as more shopping shifts online. The company has weathered the changes better than some peers, in part because it moved quickly to buy digital startups such as Trunk Club and expand its off-price chain, called Nordstrom Rack.

Nevertheless, profit tumbled 41% to $354 million for the financial year ended in January, while sales inched up nearly 3% to $14.5 billion.

ROYAL DUTCH SHELL

Higher Oil Prices

Help Boost Profit

Royal Dutch Shell PLC on Thursday capped a bumper set of results for the world's biggest oil companies with its highest quarterly profit since mid-2015, as a fragile oil-price recovery and years of cost-cutting buoyed crude producers.

Shell said its first-quarter profit more than quadrupled from a year earlier to $3.4 billion. Quarter-on-quarter, the company saw higher earnings in all business segments.

Statoil reported net first-quarter earnings of $1.06 billion, up from $611 million a year earlier.

ARCONIC

Directors Named

Ahead of Vote

Arconic Inc. added two aerospace experts to its board Thursday ahead of a shareholder vote later this month when activist investor Elliott Management Corp. will seek to oust four directors.

Weeks after the ouster of Chairman and Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld over a letter he wrote to Elliott's founder, the aerospace and automotive parts maker has named former Boeing Co. executive James F. Albaugh and Janet C. Wolfenbarger, a retired Air Force four-star general, to its board.

Ratan Tata, of the famed Indian conglomerate family, will step down from Arconic's board, keeping it at 13 members.

Elliott is running a slate of four nominees and has argued the board needs more new faces, even after Mr. Kleinfeld's exit.

AIR FRANCE-KLM

Loss Grows Wider

On Strong Dollar

Air France-KLM SA on Thursday reported a larger first-quarter operating loss, weighed down by the strong dollar even as the airline group said bookings in its long-haul sector for the coming months were running ahead of last year's level.

The airline group posted a 216 million euros ($235 million) net loss for the January through March period, or 61 million euros worse than the prior year.

The more closely watched operating loss deteriorated by 44% to 143 million euros.

2017-08-02,AIG,That's The Spirit Boeing -- Market Talk,"0820 ET - The remaking of the Boeing (BA) supply chain is progressing at a breathless pace, with no move more potentially significant than the memorandum of undertanding for a new master agreement with Spirit AeroSystems (SPR). The two sides have been negotiating for some time, and though the planned pact stretches only through 2022, it's a marked change from April when the gap between the sides was described by SPR as ""significant."" The scant details ahead of the SPR 2Q call do point to some sharing of the pain on the cost of components such as 737 fuselages and engine mountings, and SPR up 10% in pre-open trade.

Goldman Sachs ' basket of stocks of firms with the most international sales has risen 18% this year, versus the 7% gain of US firms with high domestic sales. The moves represent a reversal of the period between Election Day and the end of 2016, when hopes for stronger economic growth under the Trump administration boosted the dollar and shares of small-capitalization companies. Softer economic data has since led to an unwinding of that trade, although GS sees the dollar strengthening by about 7% over the next 12 months relative to the yen, the pound and the yuan.

That's right, it's time to sell Apple Inc .","This column isn't investment advice, of course. But far-fetched as it might seem, the record is clear. The S&P 500-listed company with the largest market value has steadily lagged behind the broader index over the past 45 years, accumulating a deficit of more than 8,000 percentage points, according to data compiled by Ned Davis Research Inc .

That means that the decision to buy the most popular U.S. stock -- which at various times has meant AT&T Inc ., Alphabet Inc ., Altria Group Inc ., Apple, Cisco Systems Inc ., Exxon Mobil Corp ., General Electric Co ., International Business Machines Corp ., Microsoft Corp . or Wal-Mart Stores Inc . -- has almost invariably cost investors significant sums.

Some of those firms continued to excel as businesses while at the top of the market heap, and others began to cool off. But firm performance is only part of the story.

More likely, the large gap -- a cumulative gain of 8,773% for the S&P 500 total return index, vs. 700% for the largest-stock group -- points to the limits of prospective returns on investments that have already appreciated significantly, as a most-valued firm's shares typically have. ""Momentum is a powerful thing,"" said Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research . But eventually, ""large numbers start to work against you.""

That dynamic may well extend to firms beyond Apple. The five biggest S&P 500 stocks now are the technology firms often extolled in the press and on Wall Street for their supposed alacrity as ""disrupters"" of the competition. Joining Apple are Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft , Facebook Inc . and Amazon.com Inc ., all with market values approaching or exceeding $500 billion.

The concerted advance of these firms -- each is up at least 17% this year including dividends -- is prompting many investors to question whether the biggest tech stocks are ""priced for perfection,"" market shorthand for the idea that at the current price investors are anticipating significant future business gains without discounting likely reversals.

For instance Apple, with a market value of $808 billion, recently accounted for 4% of the market capitalization of the S&P 500. It is a level that only a few firms, including Cisco , Exxon and General Electric , have attained in the past quarter-century or so. It is one that none has maintained for very long.

""It's a club you should never aspire to,"" said Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer of at Leuthold Group LLC in Minneapolis, with $1.5 billion under management.

Of course, there is no saying Apple won't keep going. Since it began its latest run as the most valuable S&P 500 stock in May 2016, Apple has added more than $300 billion in market value. And it is far from clear that Apple's best days are behind it. The shares this past week posted their largest daily gain since Feb. 1 after the Cupertino, Calif., company said earnings per share for its fiscal third quarter rose 17% from a year ago on a 7% revenue gain.

Analysts continue to expect Apple shares to soar, and why not. The firm's revenue outlook for its fourth quarter was stronger than expected, thanks in part to the 10th anniversary iPhone. Despite posting a 14% annual return since 2012, Apple shares still trade at a discount to market earnings multiples.

Even so, the company's value implies some hefty expectations. With $808 billion in hand, you could purchase the entire S&P Small-Cap index and still have some $90 billion in walking-around money. ""I think I'd rather own those 600 companies,"" Mr. Ramsey said.

2017-08-25,WFC,Banks Serve Up a Mortgage Mix -- WSJ,"Blend Labs strikes deal with Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp to push more home loans online 


By Peter Rudegeair ","This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (August 25, 2017).

Wells Fargo & Co. and U.S. Bancorp have signed deals with mortgage-software startup Blend Labs Inc. to move more of their loan applications online.

The five-year-old San Francisco company announced its new customers Thursday along with a fresh $100 million fundraising round.

The software from Blend offers the two lenders a chance to compete better against nimble financial-technology offerings such as Rocket Mortgage, the Quicken Loans Inc. product that has attempted to speed up the often-tedious mortgage application process.

Minneapolis-based U.S. Bank says the latest changes eventually could trim four or five days off the process, which takes roughly six weeks on average. The actual time to apply eventually could be sliced in half, says Tom Wind, president of U.S. Bank's mortgage division.

""I've never chosen a startup for a project of this size and scale before, "" said Michael DeVito, Wells Fargo's head of mortgage production. The bank, which extended $100 billion in home loans in the first half of the year, started inviting some applicants to try the Blend technology late last year. It is looking to roll out the product nationally in 2018.

Blend, part of a new crop of fintech firms that aim to work with banks rather than compete directly against them, said the fundraising round was led by venture-capital firm Greylock Partners. Greylock's Jerry Chen is joining Blend's board. The $100 million deal will bring the company's valuation to roughly $500 million, according to people familiar with the matter.

Other Blend investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Emergence Capital, Founders Fund, and Conversion Capital LLC.

Blend's software already is used for websites or smartphone applications at about 30 lenders, including Movement Mortgage LLC.

In addition to powering a version of the product that is similar to Rocket Mortgage, Blend can be used by loan officers based in retail branches or call centers. The ability to serve those different groups helped persuade banks that Blend simply wasn't looking to replace their existing sales staff with computers.

The company's software automates the loan-application process by filling in forms electronically through direct connections to information sources.

For example, Blend taps Intuit Inc. to pull figures from tax returns filed through TurboTax, Automatic Data Processing Inc. to verify income via pay stubs, and Plaid Technologies Inc. to find the value of assets in bank and brokerage accounts.

Run by CEO Nima Ghamsari, Blend expects to use the proceeds from its fundraising to expand in other forms of consumer credit and develop technology to make other manual parts of the home-loan process, such as appraisal and closing, more digital.

The latest fundraising would signal to lenders that the company would be able to ride out any market dips, Mr. Ghamsari said.

Wells Fargo executives have mentioned its work with Blend in recent months, without giving details. While Blend has worked closely with banks, the business model for online lenders of taking them on directly has struggled.

Making loans to consumers and small business directly over the internet and getting money managers to bear the risk of defaults captivated investors as recently as 2015. But a series of stumbles helped lead to a wave of layoffs, executive changes and a 75% slump in venture-capital investment in the sector.

""There's definite skepticism around whether or not these things will be legacies or whether they'll be fads,"" Mr. Ghamsari said of Silicon Valley's online lenders. He said their ascent helped raise awareness among traditional financial institutions, which had spent the preceding years wholly focused on regulatory compliance, not innovation.

Other companies in online lending also have branched out to building software for banks. Last year, On Deck Capital Inc. started making small-business loans to customers of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. via the bank's website.

""Success in the [online] lending industry in the U.S. is likely to come from partnering with the incumbents to become services enablers for them, "" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a recent report, ""as opposed to outright competing with them as independent pure play providers.""

Its outstanding balances for general-purpose and co-branded cards totaled around $26.4 billion at the end of last year, up from about $6.5 billion in 2007 when the bank's ranking by this measure was 14th. Citi has remained among the top five U.S. credit card lenders during this period.

Blackstone Group LP is getting into the music business.

The New York private-equity firm is in advanced talks to buy music-rights manager Sesac, according to people familiar with the matter. The purchase price couldn't be learned, but the Nashville company in 2013 sold a 75% stake to its current owner, private-equity firm Rizvi Traverse Management LLC, for $600 million.

The deal would mark the first-ever music-industry buyout by Blackstone.

In Sesac, Blackstone is betting on a little-known but important player in the music business. The company licenses song rights for clients including Bob Dylan, Neil Diamond and Rush to radio stations and others. It was founded in 1930.

After Elliott Criticism

Marathon Petroleum Corp. announced plans to accelerate so-called drop-down deals and conduct a strategic review of its Speedway assets, months after hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. raised concerns.

Marathon said it would significantly accelerate a drop-down of assets to MPLX LP, a master limited partnership formed by Marathon Petroleum.

The company also said that a committee of the board will conduct a review of Speedway, its company-owned and operated convenience stores and gas stations. Marathon Petroleum Chairman Gary Heminger said the moves will unlock shareholder value. Elliott said Tuesday that it was pleased with the actions.

Samson Resources Corp. has given junior creditors until Friday to stand down from a bankruptcy-court confrontation over the oil-and-gas company's future, warning that the $168.5 million junior creditors are being offered will decline if they press ahead with a rival chapter 11 exit plan.

Talks in 2016 brought the Oklahoma company and the committee representing unsecured creditors close to a deal that would allow the company to exit bankruptcy peacefully.

Instead of an all-out liquidation, Samson's creditors agreed to take the cash. However, Samson and the committee are at odds over provisions that could trigger a sale of remaining assets, Samson's lawyers said in court papers.

Lawyers for the official creditors committee couldn't immediately be reached Tuesday to respond.

NEW YORK, Jan. 26, 2017

NEW YORK, Jan. 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Greenhill & Co., Inc. (NYSE: GHL) today reported total revenues of $335.5 million and net income allocated to common stockholders of $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Diluted earnings per share were $1.89 for the year ended December 31, 2016.

The Firm's 2016 total revenues compare to total revenues of $261.6 million for 2015, which represents an increase of $73.9 million, or 28%. Advisory revenues for 2016 were $334.8 million, compared to $260.3 million for 2015, representing an increase of $74.5 million, or 29%. For 2016, investment revenues were $0.7 million compared to $1.3 million in 2015.

The Firm's 2016 net income allocated to common stockholders of $60.8 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.89 compare to net income allocated to common stockholders of $25.6 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.82 for 2015, representing increases of $35.2 million, or 137%, and $1.07, or 130%, respectively.

The Firm's fourth quarter total revenues were $101.6 million compared to total revenues of $75.7 million for the same period in 2015, representing an increase of $25.9 million, or 34%. Advisory revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $101.5 million, an increase of $26.4 million, or 35%, from the fourth quarter of 2015.

The Firm's fourth quarter net income allocated to common stockholders was $23.7 million compared to net income allocated to common stockholders of $7.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $15.8 million, or 200%. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $0.74 compared to $0.25 for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $0.49 per share, or 196%.

The Firm's revenues and net income can fluctuate materially depending on the number, size and timing of completed transactions on which it advised and other factors. Accordingly, the revenues and net income in any particular period may not be indicative of future results.

""Our strong fourth quarter and full year results were consistent in all respects with what we have been communicating to investors since early 2016. Despite a challenging market environment in which reported results to date suggest that our competitor group (both large banks and independent firms) suffered an aggregate decline in annual advisory revenues of around 5%, we grew advisory revenues 29%. We believe this is very likely the first or second highest increase of any of the 15 firms that report advisory revenue figures. We also delivered on our objectives for the year of a slightly lower compensation ratio, lower non-compensation costs in absolute terms and a much lower tax rate. As a result, we achieved a 26% pre-tax profit margin for the year, which we also believe is likely the best among our peer group, and more than doubled our prior year net income and earnings per share. With the resulting robust cash flow, we were able to both pay our substantial dividend and repurchase significant stock, while still ending the year in an improved financial position,"" Robert F. Greenhill, Chairman, said.

""Our full year results demonstrate the strength and diversity of the business we have built over 21 years. Our large increase in revenues came despite numerous headwinds: reduced global transaction activity, a record year for failed transactions, a strong dollar that diminished the value of foreign fee income, modest contributions to revenue from several regions including Australia, Japan and Latin America, and a decline in capital advisory revenue as periods of market volatility at the beginning, middle and end of the year negatively impacted transaction activity levels. Based on our backlog of assignments coming into the new year, we continue to expect the Firm to have a strong start to 2017. Over the course of the full year, we expect to benefit from improved results in most or all of the above areas that were modest contributors in 2016, and we believe that changes flowing from the recent U.S. elections should favorably impact both corporate profitability and business confidence, resulting in a continued robust level of deal activity in our largest market. We also note the prospect of a possible U.S. corporate income tax cut, which could significantly increase our earnings and cash flow and allow us to bring cash back from overseas to reduce debt and/or increase returns of capital to shareholders,"" Scott L. Bok, Chief Executive Officer, commented.

Advisory Revenues

Full Year

For the year ended December 31, 2016, advisory revenues were $334.8 million compared to $260.3 million in 2015, an increase of 29%. At the same time, the number of worldwide completed M&A transactions in 2016 decreased by 1% as compared to 2015, while the volume of completed transactions (reflecting the sum of all transaction sizes) decreased by 2%. For 2016, the number of announced M&A transactions globally remained constant with 2015, while the volume of announced transactions decreased by 18%.(1)

The increase in our 2016 advisory revenues, as compared to 2015, resulted from a greater number of completed merger and acquisition transactions with fees which were generally larger in scale than the prior year, offset in part by a decrease in other corporate advisory fees.

In 2016, we advised on transactions for the first time for such leading companies around the world as Boehringer Ingelheim, Derma Sciences, Inc., Digital Realty Trust, Inc., Etrion Corporation, Fairway Group Holdings Corp., First Republic Bank, GoDaddy Inc., Greencore Group plc, Heartland Payment Systems, Inc., IVE Group, Lane Industries Incorporated, MANN + HUMMEL GmbH, Patties Foods Ltd, OctoPar Participacoes S.A., Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc., U.S. Bancorp and Whistler Blackcomb Holdings Inc. We also advised on new transactions for historic clients in all major markets including Alcoa Inc., A.O. Smith Corporation, Ball Corporation, Commonwealth of Australia Department of Finance, Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, Emerson Electric Co., Gannett Co., Inc., Inchcape PLC, Ladbrokes plc, Lonmin plc, QLT, Inc., SUPERVALU Inc., TEGNA Inc., Telecity Group plc, Tesco PLC, and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd.

(1) Source: Thomson Financial as of January 25, 2017. Number of transactions refers to those greater than $100,000.

By geographic region in 2016, North America, where we generated 57% of our revenues, remained our largest contributor. In Europe, where we derived 30% of our revenues in 2016, our revenues in absolute dollars nearly doubled from 2015 despite a decline in transaction activity in that region prompted in part by the Brexit vote. In the rest of the world, in absolute dollars, our revenues declined slightly.

Press Release: Greenhill & Co. Reports Fourth -2-

By industry sector in 2016, large revenue increases over 2015 in consumer & retail, energy & utilities, financial services, healthcare, real estate and the technology, communications & media sector were offset in part by a decline in revenues generated from our activities in the general industrial sector (the category in which we include miscellaneous sectors).

During 2016, our global capital advisory group advised real estate fund general partners on five final closings of primary capital commitments from institutional investors in such funds. In addition, the secondary team (formerly known as Cogent Partners) within our capital advisory group advised institutional investors on 83 closings of sales of limited partnership interests in secondary market transactions. For 2016, we generated 15% of our advisory revenues from our capital advisory business, and in absolute dollars our revenues declined slightly from the prior year, due to a slowdown in transaction activity as a result of market volatility throughout the year.

In an effort to facilitate teamwork and synergies between our primary and secondary capital advisory businesses we are centralizing our Asian operations in Hong Kong, with personnel relocating there from elsewhere. Historically, Cogent Partners had a small team in Singapore that supported the global activities, while the Firm's primary capital advisory effort was based in Hong Kong.

We earned advisory revenues from 212 different clients in 2016, up 8% compared to 197 in 2015. Of this group of clients, 47% were new to the Firm in 2016. We earned $1 million or more from 71 clients in 2016, up 11% compared to 64 in 2015. The ten largest fee-paying clients contributed 40% of our total revenues in 2016 and 32% in 2015. There was no single client in 2016 or 2015 that represented greater than 10% of our revenues.

Fourth Quarter

Advisory revenues were $101.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $75.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 35%. The increase in our advisory revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, resulted from increases in transaction completion fees, which were greater in scale than the same period in the prior year, partially offset by a decrease in other corporate advisory fees and fund placement revenues.

Completed assignments in the fourth quarter of 2016 included: 


   -- the representation of Alcoa Inc. on its separation into two independent, 
      publicly-traded companies; 
 
   -- the representation of certain holders of 2nd Lien Notes of Caesars 
      Entertainment Operating Company, Inc. in connection with its 
      restructuring; 
 
   -- the sale by Etrion Corporation of its Italian solar photovoltaic platform 
      to Ultor S.p.A.; 
 
   -- the representation of F+W Media, Inc. on the sale of consumer book 
      publisher Adams Media to Simon & Schuster, a division of CBS Corporation; 
 
   -- the acquisition by First Republic Bank of Gradifi, Inc.; 
 
   -- the acquisition by Greencore Group plc of Peacock Foods; 
 
   -- the representation of a special committee of the Board of Directors of 
      IAC/InterActive Corp on the proposed creation of a new class of 
      non-voting stock; 
 
   -- the acquisition by Inchcape PLC of a multi-country scale distribution 
      business from subsidiaries and affiliates of Empresas Indumotora S.A.; 
 
   -- the representation of IVE Group Limited on the simultaneous acquisitions 
      of Franklin Web and AIW Printing; 
 
   -- the merger of Ladbrokes plc with certain businesses of Gala Coral Group 
      Limited; 
 
   -- the sale of ROFIN-SINAR Technologies, Inc. to Coherent, Inc.; 
 
   -- the representation of SUPERVALU INC. on  the sale of its Save-A-Lot 
      business to an affiliate of Onex Corporation; 
 
   -- the representation of Texas Competitive Electric Holdings and its 
      subsidiaries at the direction of its independent director in connection 
      with its and Energy Future Holdings' Chapter 11 proceedings; 
 
   -- the merger of QLT Inc. with Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and 
 
   -- the sale of Whistler Blackcomb Holdings Inc. to Vail Resorts, Inc. 

During the fourth quarter of 2016, our global capital advisory group advised real estate fund general partners on three interim closing and two final closings of primary capital commitments from institutional investors in such funds. In addition, our secondary capital advisory group advised institutional investors on 32 closings of sales of limited partnership interests in secondary market transactions.

In the fourth quarter of 2016, Ed Welsh (a former U.K. government official and prior to that a Managing Director and Global Co-Head of the Business Services sector team at Rothschild Investment Bank) joined the Firm as a Managing Director focused on the Business Services sector based in our London office.

Also in January 2017, as part of our annual evaluation and promotion process, the Firm named six new client facing Managing Directors: Jay Barnes (New York), Scott Beckelman (New York), Carlo Bosco (London), David Goldberg (Toronto), Briac Houtteville (London) and Isaias Sznifer (SÃ£o Paulo). With these promotions the Firm currently has 73 client facing Managing Directors.

In addition, the Firm also named four members of its internal finance and legal staff as Managing Directors: Naomi Buffery (London), Robert Knox (New York), Mark Lasky (New York) and Ricardo Lima (New York).

Investment Revenues

We generate a small portion of our revenues from interest income and gains (or losses) in our historic merchant banking fund investments, which we substantially liquidated in prior years. Revenue recognized on investments in merchant banking funds is based on our allocable share of realized and unrealized gains (or losses) reported by such funds on a quarterly basis.

Full Year

For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded investment revenues of $0.7 million compared to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The investment revenues for 2016 and 2015 primarily consisted of interest income.

Fourth Quarter

For the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015, we recorded investment revenues, primarily related to interest income, of $0.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively.

Expenses

Operating Expenses

Full Year

For the year ended December 31, 2016, total operating expenses were $247.6 million compared to $218.3 million in 2015. The increase of $29.3 million, or 13%, resulted principally from an increase in our compensation and benefits expenses, offset in part by a decrease in non-compensation expenses, both as described in more detail below. Our pre-tax income margin was 26% for 2016 as compared to 17% for 2015.

Fourth Quarter

Our total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $69.2 million compared to $61.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in total operating expenses of $7.7 million, or 13%, principally resulted from an increase in our compensation and benefits expenses, partially offset by a decrease in non-compensation expenses as described in more detail below. Our pre-tax margin was 32% for the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to 19% for the fourth quarter of 2015.

The following table sets forth information relating to our operating expenses for the three month periods and years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, which are reported net of reimbursements of certain expenses by our clients:

Compensation and Benefits Expenses

Full Year

For the year ended December 31, 2016, our employee compensation and benefits expenses were $182.5 million as compared to $147.2 million for the same period in the prior year. During 2016 and 2015, we incurred similar amounts of base compensation and amortization of restricted stock awards and the increase of $35.3 million, or 24%, in our employee compensation and benefits expenses was related to our higher annual revenues and was principally attributable to an increase in incentive compensation, a portion of which was paid prior to year end. The ratio of compensation to revenues was 54% in 2016, which was consistent with our compensation ratio in 2014 and 2013, as compared to 56% in 2015.

Fourth Quarter

Our employee compensation and benefits expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $53.1 million, which reflected a 52% ratio of compensation to revenues. This amount compared to $43.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, which reflected a 57% ratio of compensation to revenues. The increase of $9.6 million, or 22%, was principally attributable to higher revenues during the period, partially offset by a lower compensation ratio, which resulted from the amount of compensation determined for the full year.

Our compensation expense is generally based upon revenues and can fluctuate materially in any particular period depending upon the changes in headcount, amount of revenues recognized, as well as other factors. Accordingly, the amount of compensation expense recognized in any particular period may not be indicative of compensation expense in a future period.

Non-Compensation Expenses

Full Year

26 Jan 2017 16:01 ET 
Press Release: Greenhill & Co. Reports Fourth -3-

For the year ended December 31, 2016, our non-compensation expenses of $65.2 million decreased $5.9 million, or 8%, from $71.1 million in 2015. The decrease in non-compensation expenses principally resulted from lower occupancy costs related to lower cost levels outside of the U.S. and the sublease of redundant Cogent space, the benefit of foreign currency gains versus foreign currency losses in the prior year, lower professional fees principally due to the absence of transactions costs incurred with the acquisition of Cogent, partially offset by a full year of operating and borrowing costs related to the acquisition of Cogent and an increase in the charge for the change in the estimated fair value of the contingent cash consideration for the Cogent earnout. Interest expense, included within non-compensation expenses, was $3.2 million for 2016 and $2.5 million for 2015.

Non-compensation expenses as a percentage of revenues for 2016 were 19% compared to 27% for 2015. The decrease in non-compensation expenses as a percentage of revenues resulted from the effect of spreading lower non-compensation costs over significantly higher revenues in 2016 as compared to 2015.

Fourth Quarter

Our non-compensation expenses were $16.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $18.0 million in the same period in 2015, representing a decrease of $1.9 million, or 11%. The decrease in non-compensation expenses principally resulted from lower travel costs, which were higher than normal in the fourth quarter of 2015, lower occupancy costs, and the absence of a charge in the fourth quarter of 2016 for a change in the estimated fair value of the contingent cash consideration for the Cogent earnout. Interest expense, included within non-compensation expenses, was $0.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $0.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2015.

Non-compensation expenses as a percentage of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 16% compared to 24% for the same period in 2015. The decrease in non-compensation expenses as a percentage of revenues resulted from the effect of spreading lower non-compensation costs over significantly higher revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.

In connection with our purchase of Cogent, we agreed to pay additional consideration of $18.9 million in cash and issue 334,048 shares of our common stock if a revenue target of $80.0 million was achieved during either of the two-year periods ending April 1, 2017 or April 1, 2019. The fair value of the contingent cash consideration was valued on the date of our purchase at $13.1 million and is remeasured quarterly based on a probability weighted present value discount that the revenue target may be achieved. Based on our remeasurement of the likelihood of achieving the revenue target we incurred charges of $0.5 million and $1.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively. With one quarter remaining in the first two-year period, the remaining revenue required in the first quarter of the year (historically a lower revenue quarter than average) to meet the target is $10.9 million, which is a slightly higher level than the average for the past seven quarters. We are not currently able to determine with certainty whether or not the revenue target for the period ending March 31, 2017 will be achieved. If the target is not achieved we will most likely incur a small benefit on the measurement of the present value of the probability that the revenue target may be achieved during the second two year period ending April 1, 2019, and if the earnout is achieved we will incur a charge to non-compensation expense of $3.8 million pursuant to the same calculation.

Our non-compensation expenses as a percentage of revenues can vary as a result of a variety of factors including fluctuation in revenue amounts, changes in headcount, the amount of recruiting and business development activity, the amount of office expansion, the amount of reimbursement of engagement-related expenses by clients, the amount of borrowings, interest rate and currency movements and other factors, such as the contingent earnout. Accordingly, the non-compensation expenses as a percentage of revenues in any particular period may not be indicative of the non-compensation expenses as a percentage of revenues in future periods.

Provision for Income Taxes

Full Year

For the year ended December 31, 2016, the provision for taxes was $27.1 million, which reflected an effective tax rate of 31%. This compared to a provision for taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $17.7 million, which reflected an effective tax rate of 41%.

The increase in the provision for income taxes of $9.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, resulted from substantially higher pre-tax income, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate, which resulted from the generation of a greater proportion of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, we (and all publicly traded companies that issue restricted stock awards) will be subject to a new accounting requirement which will require us to record in our provision for income taxes at the time of vesting of restricted stock awards a charge or benefit for the tax effect of the difference between the grant price value and market price value of the awards. In prior years the tax effect of this difference was recorded as a charge or benefit to stockholders equity. Based on our current market price, the average grant price of the awards vesting in 2017 exceeds the market price of our shares. If the share price remains at its current value at the time of vesting of the awards, the majority of which occurs annually in late January, we expect we will incur an increase in tax expense in the first quarter of 2017. This change in accounting requirement will have no impact on cash taxes, and therefore we intend going forward to provide shareholders with supplemental information regarding our taxes and net income and earnings per share excluding such accounting provision.

Fourth Quarter

For the fourth quarter of 2016, the provision for income taxes was $8.7 million, which reflected an effective rate of 27%. This compared to a provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2015 of $6.3 million, which reflected an effective tax rate of 44%.

The increase in the provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2016 of $2.4 million, as compared to the same period in 2015, resulted from substantially higher pre-tax income, partially offset by a significantly lower effective tax rate, which resulted from the generation of a greater proportion of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates and the absence of certain non-deductible foreign losses.

The effective tax rate can fluctuate as a result of variations in the relative amounts of income earned and the tax rate imposed in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Accordingly, the effective tax rate in any particular period may not be indicative of the effective tax rate in future periods.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $98.3 million and short-term revolving debt of $64.1 million. Additionally, as of December 31, 2016 we had $16.9 million outstanding on the term loan facility related to the funding of the acquisition of Cogent, which has three equal semi-annual installments remaining, with the next installment due on April 30, 2017.

We intend to make future installment payments of the outstanding term debt through our operating cash flow. In the event the Cogent earnout is achieved in April 2017 we expect to fund the cash payment through operating cash flow, additional borrowings from our revolving bank loan facility, additional bank term borrowing, and/or cash repatriated from abroad.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Firm repurchased 264,562 shares of its common stock in open market purchases at an average price of $28.35 per share, for a total cost of $7.5 million.

For the full year 2016, the Firm repurchased 891,017 shares of its common stock in open market purchases and 319,573 restricted stock units from employees at the time of vesting to settle tax liabilities, for an aggregate of 1,210,590 shares of our common stock and common stock equivalent repurchased at an average price of $23.28 per share, for a total cost of $28.2 million.

The Board of Directors of Greenhill & Co. Inc. has authorized the repurchase of up to $75 million of common stock during 2017.

Dividend

The Board of Directors of Greenhill & Co., Inc. has declared a dividend of $0.45 per share to be paid on March 22, 2017 to common stockholders of record on March 8, 2017.

Railroad to Cut","Costs Further

Norfolk Southern Corp. posted a decline in revenue but notched higher profit in its fourth quarter as it cut costs, an effort it said it would continue as rival railway operators are pushed to take similar belt-tightening measures.

The Norfolk, Va., company Wednesday said it planned to cut $650 million in annual costs by 2020. Norfolk Southern cut $250 million in annual costs in 2016 and plans to cut $100 million more this year.

In all for the period, the company posted a profit of $416 million, or $1.42 a share, up from $361 million, or $1.20 a share, a year earlier. Revenue slipped 1.1% to $2.49 billion.

Norfolk Southern also said this week that it increased its quarterly dividend by 2 cents to 61 cents per share.

UNITED TECHNOLOGIES

Conglomerate Puts

Focus on Jet Engines

United Technologies Corp. said revenue was flat across its business units in the fourth quarter, as the company continues to troubleshoot issues with its newest line of jet engines and search for growth markets for its elevators and building-equipment businesses.

The Farmington, Conn., conglomerate reaffirmed its guidance for 2017. For now, much of the company's focus remains on the production of its new geared turbofan jet engine. The engine is a product on which its Pratt & Whitney unit has staked more than a decade and $10 billion of investment.

While revenue declined 1% in the company's Otis elevator unit, new equipment orders rose 3% on a constant currency basis.

In all for the quarter, United Technologies reported a profit of $1.01 billion, down from a profit of $3.28 billion in the same quarter in the previous year. On a per-share basis, the company posted earnings from continuing operations of $1.26, compared with a loss of 30 cents in the prior-year period. During the previous year's quarter, the company sold its Sikorsky helicopter unit to Lockheed Martin Corp. for $9 billion, affecting that quarter's profit and per-share earnings.

On an adjusted basis, the company reported earnings of $1.56 a share. Revenue grew 2.5% to $14.66 billion.

MATTEL

Weak Holidays

Weigh on Results

Mattel Inc. reported a sharp drop in profit and sales during its critical fourth quarter, as weak demand for toys during the holiday season forced it to resort to discounting to move unsold merchandise from store shelves.

The disappointing results come a week after the maker of Barbie dolls and Fisher-Price toys said it was hiring a Google executive, Margaret Georgiadis, to replace its Chief Executive Christopher Sinclair, who will step aside next month.

Mattel released its report a week ahead of schedule. The weak results surprised investors. Its shares fell 11% in late trading.

Fourth-quarter profit fell 19% to $173.8 million, or 50 cents a share, well below Wall Street's expectations. Global sales fell about 8% to $1.83 billion, hurt by the loss of the Disney Princess dolls business to rival Hasbro Inc. In North America, net sales fell 7%.

2017-01-26,DFS,Competition Over Cards Runs Too Hot,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

As competition heats up in credit cards, risks to investors are on the rise.","Two credit-card lenders, Capital One Financial and Discover Financial Services, reported lukewarm results on Tuesday. Shares of both fell on Wednesday against a broadly rising market.

Rewards costs are climbing as card issuers scramble to keep up with each other's cash back and travel point offers. At Discover, rewards costs rose 10.5% from a year earlier. The rate of rewards per dollar spent on its cards rose to 1.26% from 1.18% a year earlier.

Capital One doesn't break out rewards expenses in this way, instead netting them against the interchange fees it gets on every card swipe. But rewards pressure was visible here, too, as transaction fee revenue was basically flat despite a 10% rise in purchase volume.

Capital One Chief Executive Richard Fairbank warned on a conference call that the industry ""has moved into the more intense part of the competitive cycle."" Industrywide, growth in revolving debt balances has been running at about 7% a year, much faster than household incomes, he said. Subprime card loans are increasing even faster, at about 13%, he added.

Against this backdrop, Discover and Capital One both said they are staying disciplined in their lending practices. Defaults, which are already rising from historically low levels, are destined to head higher.

Shares of Capital One and Discover Financial have risen about 17% since the election. Now might be a good time for investors to take a breather.",266,article,",c1521,ccat,ncolu,ndj,nedc,neqac,nhrd,ntesi,ntop,c15,c152,ncat,nfact,nfce,nfcpex,nfcpin,redit,"
2017-01-13,LVS,"Business News: Casino Tycoon Adelson, WSJ Settle Libel Suit","The Wall Street Journal said Thursday a libel lawsuit brought by billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson against one of its reporters has been settled. The suit stemmed from a 2012 article that described Mr. Adelson as ""foul-mouthed.""

Both sides agreed that the suit would be dismissed and that each side would bear its own legal costs, a Journal spokeswoman said. No money is being paid to settle the suit, she said. The article at the heart of the suit will remain online unchanged.","A spokesman for Mr. Adelson's Las Vegas Sands Corp. had no immediate comment.

The suit, filed in 2013, accused the Journal's then-Hong Kong-based Asia gambling-industry reporter, Kate O'Keeffe, of libel, for a passage in which Mr. Adelson was described as ""a scrappy, foul-mouthed billionaire from working-class Dorchester, Mass.""

Mr. Adelson has said he isn't foul-mouthed.

A Journal spokeswoman said: ""We are pleased that the parties have agreed that the suit will be dismissed. The Journal and Ms. O'Keeffe remain fully committed to continuing to provide fair and accurate reporting in all matters, including in our coverage of Mr. Adelson and his businesses.""

The case was brought in Hong Kong, where the law makes it easier for plaintiffs to win libel cases than in the U.S., in part by putting the burden on defendants to prove the truth of the challenged statement.

But much of the four years of legal maneuvering played out across the U.S. in several jurisdictions. The Journal took action in U.S. federal courts to subpoena witnesses, including executives at Las Vegas Sands and Mr. Adelson's former bodyguard and driver, who could testify about whether he indeed was foul-mouthed.

The article that was the subject of the suit focused on a legal battle between Mr. Adelson and the former CEO of his casino operations in Macau. It was co-written with another reporter, but only Ms. O'Keeffe was named in the suit.

The suit also didn't name the Journal or its publisher, Dow Jones & Co., or parent company News Corp. The Journal defended Ms. O'Keeffe in the suit.

Ms. O'Keeffe spent six years reporting on the gambling industry from Hong Kong and wrote extensively about Las Vegas Sands, which has casinos in Macau. She reported in-depth articles about Macau's casino industry.

In court filings, the Journal said that after Mr. Adelson filed the suit against Ms. O'Keeffe a Sands spokesman asked an editor at the paper if Ms. O'Keeffe would be removed from the beat because, in the spokesman's view, the legal proceeding meant she had a conflict of interest.

Ms. O'Keeffe remained on the beat and was promoted to cover the gambling industry globally. In January 2016, she relocated to the Journal's Washington bureau, where she now reports on Chinese money and politics in the U.S. She declined to comment.",508,article,",c12,glibel,neqac,nmajev,ccat,gcat,gcrim,ncat,ndj,nfact,nfcpex,nfcpin,ntop,redit,"
2017-01-26,BK,J.P. Morgan Wins $1T In BlackRock Business From State Street -- Barron's Blog,"J.P Morgan ( JPM) has just poached big business from State Street ( STT).

The Wall Street bank announced today a deal to provide custodian services for more than $1 trillion in assets for BlackRock ( BLK), luring the business away from rivals State Street.","BlackRock called it a landmark transaction and ""among the largest custody deals ever signed.""

J.P. Morgan's custody services include settling and holding onto clients' securities for safety purposes. It also provides accounting services and administration for funds.

The bank plans to bring those assets onboard its $20.5 trillion platform over the next two years. Citing ""a person familiar with the matter,"" The Wall Street Journal says the deal may lift J.P. Morgan to the No. 2 position in the business behind Bank of New York Mellon ( BK).

What does all this mean for J.P. Morgan and State Street?

As The WSJ reports:

State Street's assets under custody were $21.7 trillion as of Wednesday when it reported fourth-quarter earnings, though it is unclear if the change was reflected in the most recent quarterly numbers. State Street noted in an earnings slide presentation Wednesday that BlackRock had moved some of its assets ""as a result of a decision to diversify service providers,"" but remains a client of the bank.

J.P. Morgan is likely to garner roughly tens of millions of dollars in annual fees in one of the largest-ever custody deals. The sticky business is becoming rare in banking where firms have been cutting costs to boost revenues in a low-interest-rate environment. These types of contracts usually don't come up for bid for years.

State Street's share price fell 4.3% to $77.05 in recent market action, while J.P. Morgan's stock price rose 1.4% to $85.91 a share.

2017-01-09,CZR,McDonald's Sells Controlling Stake in China Business Valued at Up to $2.08 Billion -- 2nd Update,"McDonald's Corp. was one of the first American brands to strike gold in China, becoming a symbol of China's opening to the West. Now it is handing over the reins here to a Chinese state-owned enterprise, in a deal that would value the business at up to $2.08 billion.

The Oak Brook, Ill., chain said Monday it is selling an 80% stake in its China operations to a group that includes Citic Ltd., its investment-management arm Citic Capital Holdings and U.S. private-equity giant Carlyle Group LP. The Citic companies will own a combined 52% stake, while Carlyle will own 28%.","The agreement is for 20 years and is expected to close this summer. The sale price will be up to $1.66 billion for the majority stake, to be held by Citic and Carlyle, depending on a final valuation of the China assets.

The deal comes as McDonald's, like other big restaurant chains, moves to a so-called asset-light structure--essentially keeping the brands but selling off the stores. The model allows companies to collect a portion of sales without the costs and liabilities that come with large workforces and extensive real-estate holdings.

McDonald's had more than 2,400 stores in mainland China and more than 240 in Hong Kong at the end of 2016. About a third of the stores in China are already franchised. All of the company's remaining stores would be franchised under the deal, with McDonald's retaining a 20% stake in them.

People familiar with the matter said McDonald's cut will be about 6% of sales, or double the 3% take that Louisville, Ky.-based competitor Yum Brands Inc. garners from its KFC and Pizza Hut brands in China. The royalty fees increase over time during the 20-year length of the agreement, the people said. A McDonald's spokeswoman declined to comment on those terms.

The parties were in deal talks for about seven months, and one recent issue that arose was how McDonald's would be able to collect its revenue in light of the Chinese government's moves to limit capital outflows, people familiar with the matter said. Capital outflows exceeding $5 million are now coming under government scrutiny.

McDonald's Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook acknowledged that, going forward, getting cash out of China will be a ""top-quality problem"" but declined to go into more detail. Previously, McDonald's reinvested most of its profit from China back into the country.

McDonald's has long-term plans to franchise 95% of its stores and is looking to do a similar sale in South Korea, Mr. Easterbrook said in an interview. He said McDonald's has no plans for a spin off in Russia, where it owns and operates about 600 stores.

Yum Brands also moved recently to lighten up its assets, spinning off its more than 5,000 KFCs and about 2,000 Pizza Hut's to form a new company, Yum China Holdings Inc. Although McDonald's is the world's largest fast food company by revenue and the No. 1 brand in most major markets, Yum has more stores in China--a situation Citic Capital chairman and chief executive Yicheng Zhang wants to change.

""China is McDonald's second largest market, but it is the No. 2 brand in terms of stores. That isn't McDonald's rightful place,"" Mr. Zhang said.

McDonald's said Monday that the new owners are committed to building 1,500 new restaurants in China and Hong Kong over the next five years. They plan to focus on China's so-called third and fourth-tier cities beyond metropolises such as Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen.

The Golden Arches have struggled in recent years to lift sales in China, most recently because of consumer protests related to U.S. opposition to China's territorial claims in the South China Sea, Mr. Easterbrook told analysts on a recent earnings call.

The China business has become intensely competitive and much more complex since the fast-food chain entered the country in the early 1990s, Mr. Easterbrook said in the interview. The sale of the China operations will accelerate plans for store expansion in the world's second-largest economy and free McDonald's from having to make those costly investments itself, he said.

""It's going to be a commercially successful outcome for us,"" Mr. Easterbrook said. ""We won't be putting capital into the market, but we will be part of the decision-making process.""

The sale puts McDonald's China business in the hands of a sprawling state-owned conglomerate that boasts a suite of financial services from banking to insurance, iron-ore mines in Australia, one of China's richest but most underachieving soccer clubs and the country's top offshore-oil helicopter-service operator. Citic Ltd. owns China's seventh-largest lender by assets, China Citic Bank, a leading investment bank Citic Securities Co., energy giant Citic Resources Holdings Ltd., and metals maker Citic Pacific Ltd.

The company doesn't have experience running fast-food chains, Mr. Zhang acknowledged, but he said its strengths in retail banking and its partnerships with real-estate and Internet companies will bring valuable expertise to the operation. He added that the consortium would retain McDonald's current management team China.

Morgan Stanley advised McDonald's on the sale. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. advised the Citic-Carlyle consortium.

2017-01-09,BSX,Parkinson's Therapy Draws Fresh Look --- Deep brain stimulation raises expectations of medical-device makers who see a market,"Deep brain stimulation, an established therapy that modifies the brain's circuitry to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders, is attracting fresh attention from medical-device makers who believe it is underused.

St. Jude Medical Inc. recently introduced a new DBS system in the U.S., and Boston Scientific Corp. is planning its own entry late next year. Both already sell the implantable devices for DBS in Europe.","The shake-up in the U.S. reflects the promise that St. Jude -- which recently combined with Abbott Laboratories -- and Boston Scientific see in a market that for years has been served by just one company: Medtronic PLC.

Although DBS accounts for just $500 million of Medtronic's roughly $30 billion in annual revenue, it is one of the company's fastest-growing areas, expanding around 9% a year, according to a company presentation at a medical meeting in late 2015. The price of a Medtronic DBS system ranges from about $18,000 to $35,000.

""The last two decades, Medtronic has done the yeoman's work of creating and legitimizing DBS,"" said Brett Wall, head of the company's brain business. ""It's about time someone else got in this market.""

Parkinson's, an incurable, degenerative neurological disease, affects around one million people in the U.S. DBS, which involves embedding a wire in the brain and a pacemaker-like unit in the chest, has been shown to significantly increase control over symptoms in those with advanced Parkinson's.

But not all patients stand to benefit from DBS. Some can control their symptoms using medication alone, while others have complications, such as dementia, that rule out surgery.

Even so, all three medical-device companies believe only a fraction of eligible patients are undergoing the surgical procedure. Maulik Nanavaty, head of neuromodulation at Boston Scientific, estimates that about 13% of Parkinson's patients who could benefit from DBS have used it. Medtronic puts that figure at around 10%.

One reason for the modest use in the U.S., according to Allen Burton, medical director of neuromodulation at St. Jude, is a lack of familiarity. Many Parkinson's patients are treated by primary-care doctors or community neurologists who lack connections with the roughly 100 specialist centers across the country that offer DBS.

The cost of DBS implantation can reach $100,000, but insurers typically reimburse most or all of the bill, according to the National Parkinson Foundation. As much of a deterrent to use is the time commitment required. The procedure involves a two-day hospital stay, plus numerous consultations before and after treatment. There is also the travel time to the specialist centers.

St. Jude is working with community neurologists to raise the profile of DBS and is considering advertising the procedure directly to patients. The device makers are also betting that improving the precision of DBS will make it more marketable.

With traditional DBS implants, the current radiates out from the end of the wire. Now Boston Scientific and St. Jude have developed devices that can ""steer"" the electrical impulse in a particular direction, with the aim of reducing side effects such as mood changes or speech difficulties. Medtronic plans to launch its own steerable device in the next two to three years, Mr. Wall said.

Another approach: advocating use of DBS at an earlier stage. DBS is typically used in patients with advanced Parkinson's, but the Food and Drug Administration earlier this year said Medtronic could market one of its devices when the disease had been diagnosed for as little as four years. That decision followed a large study by Medtronic showing that earlier-stage patients did better on medication plus DBS, compared with medication alone.

Even with such advances, medical-device makers could come up against a more fundamental problem: fear of surgery, particularly on the brain. ""Many people would avoid brain surgery if they have other options,"" said Jeff Bronstein, a neurologist at University of California, Los Angeles. ""The risks are relatively small, but if you happen to be in the 1% to 2% that has a stroke, that's a big deal.""

Concern about surgery risks means DBS is viewed ""almost as a last resort,"" according to Patrick Hickey, an assistant professor of neurology at Duke University School of Medicine who has received grant funding from Medtronic. But he said it was gradually ""becoming part of the treatment program"" as doctors became more familiar with it.

Some believe DBS has more potential still. Among them are researchers at Vanderbilt University, who believe it could go beyond controlling the symptoms of Parkinson's to delaying the progression of the disease.

David Charles, a professor of neurology at Vanderbilt who has done consulting work for Medtronic, said the research team was in the process of raising funds to run a large clinical test of that hypothesis, after a small study showed early-stage Parkinson's patients on standard therapy were two to five times more likely to worsen in two years than those using DBS.",865,article,",gpark,neqac,c23,reqrhc,reqrph,ccat,gcat,ghea,gmed,ncat,nfact,redit,reqr,"

2017-10-18,CHTR,IBM Carrying the Dow Higher -- Market Talk,"1023 ET - Thank IBM if the Dow Jones Industrial Average closes about 23000 Wednesday. Shares of the computing giant, which reported earnings on Tuesday, were recently up 9%, contributing roughly 90 points of the Dow industrials' 105 point advance. If IBM can hold its gains, it will notch its biggest one-day jump since January 2009, when it rose 12%.

"" Spectrum subscribers will continue to have access to Viacom 's networks, without disruption, while we finalize terms,"" the companies said in a joint statement. Viacom had earlier said that it had offered a package that would let Spectrum's 16.5 million subscribers pay less for its channels. Their last distribution agreement expired on Sunday. Viacom shares slip 1.6% and Charter loses 0.4%. (keach.hagey@wsj.com)

1013 ET - Encana , a Canadian oil and gas company that produces in the Permian basin and elsewhere, outlined a five-year plan for investors in which it will generate free cash flow by 2019 and generate a return on capital of 10% to 15% by 2022. Production growth will range between 10% and 15%, and debt will be only two times greater than operating earnings by next year. That mix of generating free cash flow, growing production and returns has been elusive for most shale companies over the last several years, but investors are beginning to demand changes. Encana appears to be on target or moving ahead of schedule on a number of its targets, according to Tudor Pickering Holt. (bradley.olson@wsj.com; @bradnews)

1004 ET - Hurricane Maria had a ""modest"" effect on medical-products maker Abbott Laboratories ' manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico, CEO Miles White tells analysts on 3Q earnings call. ""Our first priority was to find all our people and to aid them, which we've done,"" he said. ""The biggest issue was access to power generation in Puerto Rico, and our folks addressed that really rapidly. Our plants are back up and running."" Abbott makes vascular and other products on the island. (peter.loftus@wsj.com; @Loftus)

1003 ET - Embraer, facing a potential squeeze if the planned Airbus-Bombardier pact is sealed, is quietly moving on with the business of producing jetliners. The company says it's new E190-E2 regional jet will be delivered to launch customer Wideroe next April. That's the mid-point of Embraer's targeted first-half-of-2018, notable given the late arrival of many rival new jet models. (doug.cameron@wsj.com; @dougcameron)

0956 ET - Investors aren't expecting eye-popping results when the world's top grain-trading companies report quarterly results at the end of October, and JPMorgan analysts sympathize. US grain export volumes have sunk versus last year's high levels, though soybean processing margins have been relatively good; in South America, crop shipments have surged, but processing margins look weak, JPMorgan says. That mixed picture has kept shares of Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge behind the broader US equity market, and while 2018 is too early to call, ""we continue to view the risks as skewed to the downside,"" JPMorgan says.

0950 ET - BHP Billiton expects oil demand will continue to rise for a few years from today's needs of nearly 100M barrels per day, but expects it to peak sometime in the mid-2030s around 110M barrels a day. Even so, natural decline rates in old oil fields mean the world will need around an extra 35M barrels a day of new supply to offset what gets pumped out of the ground, said Steve Pastor , President of Petroleum for BHP, at the Oil & Money conference in London. That requires enormous investment because it's essentially replacing one-third of today's global crude supply, he says, adding that this ensures oil companies won't become irrelevant. ""We believe natural decline and a steep cost curve will create attractive investment opportunities in oil, well into the middle of this century,"" he says. (lynn.cook@wsj.com; @LynnJCook)

0945 ET - Deepwater projects can be pulled off for a lot less money and make economic sense in the age of shale, according to Steve Pastor , president of Petroleum for BHP Billiton. While speaking at the Oil & Money conference in London, Pastor says BHP and its partners sanctioned Mad Dog Phase 2 in the Gulf of Mexico with a price tag half its original. Mad Dog's cost is now around $9B, down from $20B a few years ago. This will allow ""one of the biggest discovered undeveloped oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico to be profitably developed, well below today's prices,"" Pastor says. The company achieved this by using more existing infrastructure to minimize development costs and plans to tap smaller satellite fields faster so they can generate profits faster than traditional deepwater plans normally call for. (lynn.cook@wsj.com; @LynnJCook)

0938 ET - BHP is trying to get out of US shale and refocus on deepwater drilling. The company did not fully appreciate the enormous supply of low cost gas to be unlocked by shale drillers, ""including ourselves,"" Steve Pastor , President of Petroleum for BHP Billiton, tells a London audience at the Oil & Money Conference. Even though BHP has some sweet spots in Texas shale plays, with breakevens below $50 a barrel, it doesn't see the assets as big enough or with a long enough reserve life to make sense for its portfolio. ""We simply don't see U.S. shale oil as the marginal, price-setting barrel in our global market beyond the early to mid-2020s,"" he says. (lynn.cook@wsj.com; @LynnJCook)

0919 ET - September housing starts were down 4.7% from the previous month and housing permits, a measure of future home building, was also down, declining 4.5% from August. The numbers do not bode well, at least temporarily, for those in the construction sector hoping to see builders ramp up projects in the wake of increased demand and rising prices that are beginning to price some home buyers out of the market. Recent hurricane activity could have affected this month's reading, but housing starts were already down five of the last six months. (Sharon.Nunn@WSJ.com)

0908 ET - US government bond prices fell overnight, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note rising to 2.341%, according to Tradeweb , compared with 2.300% on Tuesday. Yields have risen throughout the month as investors have increasingly bet that the Federal Reserve will raise rates once more in December and analysts have eyed the potential that, at the end of her term, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen could be replaced by a more hawkish chair. President Donald Trump , who said earlier in the week that he has narrowed the search to five candidates, including Yellen, is expected to make a decision on the Fed leadership before an upcoming trip to Asia in November. (akane.otani@wsj.com)

0835 ET - M&T Bank 's 3Q profit fell far short of analysts' expectations as the company's loan growth and noninterest income both fell. Total loans and leases fell 2% largely because of a 14% drop in real-estate loans to consumers. Noninterest income also fell 6% in the quarter. The Buffalo, NY, bank's EPS came in at $2.21 while analysts expected $2.40. Shares were down 1.2% in premarket trading on low volume. (allison.prang@wsj.com; @AllisonPrang)

18:17 Brazilian private-equity firm 3G Capital's habit of hiring young executives for top roles has helped it save money at companies it runs. With Kraft Heinz's new CFO named at age 29 last month, the same theme plays out. In a filing late Friday, Kraft Heinz revealed the recently promoted David Knopf will receive a salary of $500,000 and annual performance-related bonus of up to $875,000. The average age of someone starting a CFO role is 50, according to recruiting firm Korn/Ferry , and most in the food industry are paid more than that. However, for someone of his age, he'll be earning a lot. ( annie.gasparro@wsj.com )","2154 GMT - Net bets on higher prices for natural gas fell in the week ended Tuesday, as warmer weather forecasts weighed on expectations for demand. According to the CFTC, net bullish bets by hedge funds and other speculative investors totaled 52,414, down 12,278 from the previous week. Investors cut 9,630 on rising prices, and added 2,648 bets on falling prices. Natural gas futures edged up slightly to $2.974 a million British thermal units during the week ended Tuesday. (alison.sider@wsj.com; @alyrose)

2148 GMT - ISS recommends shareholders support EQT's planned purchase of Rice Energy , which is under pressure from activist Jana and hedge fund DE Shaw. The opinion sent shares of both EQT and Rice popping, and almost entirely eliminated the deal spread. While ISS rejects shareholder idea to shoot down the deal, ISS does give them backing on key argument to break up EQT, even if it takes place after the deal. ISS says even though the deal is ""only mildly accretive"" it could ""deliver meaningful value if it facilitates the resolution of EQT's sum-of-the-parts discount."" ISS applauds management for making promises, under pressure, to commit to reassure investors. Rice ends up 8.4% to $28.51, EQT up 5.4% to $63.31. Deal would be worth $28.72/share for Rice at those prices. (david.benoit@wsj.com; @DaveCBenoit)

2120 GMT - Net bullish bets on oil rose in the week ended Tuesday, according to the latest data from the CFTC. Bullish bets outnumbered bearish bets by 234,878, up from 219,077 the previous week. Hedge funds, money managers and other speculative investors added 9,675 bets on rising prices and cut bets on falling prices by 6,126. Oil prices rose 1.1% during the week ended Tuesday, boosted by geopolitical risks, particularly in Iraq, as well as growing confidence that OPEC and other exporters including Russia will continue cutting output.

2003 GMT - Fitch affirms its ratings for Canada's banks Friday, but adds they could be vulnerable to a housing market correction. Fitch rates the Royal Bank of Canada at AA, and the other large banks--CIBC, Toronto-Dominion Bank , Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal at AA-. The ratings firm lowers the outlook for CIBC to negative from stable, citing higher mortgage lending. The banks benefit from strong operations, but are exposed to a housing market where prices are overvalued by roughly 25%, says Fitch. Meanwhile consumer debt to disposable income is at 169.9%, the highest in the G7. (vipal.monga@wsj.com ; @vipalmonga)

1453 GMT - Warren Buffett reiterated at an event Thursday that the market for bitcoin is in bubble territory. Bitcoin is trading around $5,780, according to www.dailyfx.com, more than eight times higher than this time a year ago. The cryptocurrency has risen recently, but failed to breach the psychologically significant $6,000 level. Buffett says he remains skeptical on bitcoin because one can't put value on it since it isn't a value-producing asset. Other prominent people in the financial world have also criticized bitcoin, including JPMorgan's CEO James Dimon . Goldman Sachs , however, may introduce a trading desk for bitcoin, according to reports, one of the reasons why the blockchain-backed currency has risen recently. (olga.cotaga@wsj.com; @OlgaCotaga)

1432 GMT - A U.S. fine for Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC over its role in packaging toxic sub-prime mortgages before the financial crisis could snuff out hopes of its first profit in a decade, says Hargreaves Lansdown . RBS said Friday it was optimistic about reaching a deal this year with the U.S. Department of Justice . Analysts expect any fine to run to several billion dollars. ""RBS faces the indignity of suffering a tenth year without a profit, though this really all depends on the timing and size of the fine,"" says HL's Laith Khalaf . ""The fact the bank has said it expects to be profitable next year suggests RBS is bracing for a pretty imminent rap on the knuckles."" RBS shares rise 2% to 287 pence. (philip.waller@wsj.com)

1422 GMT - Investors' appetite for risky assets is picking up. The pace of inflows into corporate bonds and equity funds has accelerated in recent weeks, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysis of EPFR Global data, with the two posting a combined $534B in inflows year-to-date--on track for their biggest inflows ever. Accelerating economic growth in the US, which posted a better-than-expected GDP reading Friday, and elsewhere around the world, has helped boost corporate profits and keep US stock indexes climbing this year. (akane.otani@wsj.com)

1419 GMT - Intercontinental Exchange is making a play for Canada after UK regulators blocked its effort to beef up its presence in European energy markets. That's the upshot of ICE 's deal to sell Trayport , a UK-based provider of energy-trading software, to TMX Group , owner of the Toronto Stock Exchange. Under the deal, announced this morning, ICE will sell Trayport to TMX in exchange for GBP350M in cash ($460M) and two of TMX's assets: NGX, an Alberta-based electricity and natural gas exchange, and Shorcan Energy Brokers, a crude oil brokerage. The deal, expected to close later this year or early next year, subject to regulatory approval, would further expand ICE 's already large footprint in North American energy markets. The UK's antitrust watchdog ruled last year that ICE had to sell Trayport , whose technology is heavily used in European utilities trading. The Atlanta-based exchange operator agreed to buy Trayport in 2015 for $650M. (alexo@wsj.com; @aosipovich)

1418 GMT - Aviva PLC could launch a GBP1 billion share buy-back next year, says Barclays as it upgrades the U.K. insurer to over-weight. The brokerage believes Aviva can deploy GBP1.5 billion of excess liquidity in the form of GBP1 billion of cash returns and a GBP500 million debt reduction, returning proceeds from asset sales, dividends from U.K. life operations and ongoing cash generation. ""We are increasing our price target by 11% to 567p, offering 18% total return,"" Barclays says. Aviva shares rise 0.1% to 512 pence. (philip.waller@wsj.com)

1406 GMT - Subordinated bonds of Catalonia-exposed CaixaBank and Banco de Sabadell feel the heat after the Catalan parliament voted to declare independence Friday. The two banks' contingent convertible, or CoCo, euro bonds reverse intraday gains after the vote, according to Tradeweb . Nevertheless, they still remain well above levels recorded before the European Central Bank 's policy announcement Thursday.(tasos.vossos@wsj.com; @tasosvos)

1403 GMT - Bonds backed by CVS and Aetna have sagged after The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the companies are in merger talks, with CVS mulling a price of more than $66B for the health insurer. At that price and not including potential synergies, CVS would likely need to fund the deal with at least 60% equity to remain investment-grade, according to CreditSights. That would mean new debt of around $25B and put rent-adjusted leverage of the combined company in the 4.0x area, per CreditSights. CVS's 5.125% bonds due 2045 traded Friday morning at 145 basis points above Treasurys, up from 136 basis points before the Journal story, according to MarketAxess. The spread on Aetna 's 3.875% notes due 2047 moved up to 125 basis points from 95 basis points. (sam.goldfarb@wsj.com)

Press Release: Fitch Takes Rating Actions on Large Regional Banks Following Peer Review


 
 
The following is a press release from Fitch Ratings : 
 ","Fitch Ratings -Chicago-03 October 2017: Following its peer review of large regional banks, Fitch Ratings has taken various rating actions.

Fitch upgraded Regions Financial Corporation 's (RF) ratings to 'BBB+', and revised the bank's Rating Outlook to Stable from Positive. In addition, Fitch downgraded Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) and Wells Fargo & Company 's ratings and assigned both entities Stable Outlooks (WFC). Fitch affirmed the ratings on Comerica Incorporated (CMA) and KeyCorp (KEY) and revised their Outlooks to Stable from Negative.

Fitch affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) for the remaining large regional banks (listed below) in the peer review with Stable Outlooks.

--BB&T Corporation (BBT);

--Capital One Financial Corporation (COF);

--Citizens Financial Group (CFG);

--Huntington Bancshares Inc . (HBAN);

--M&T Bank Corporation (MTB);

--MUFG Americas Holding Corporation (MUAH);

--PNC Financial Services Group (PNC);

--SunTrust Banks, Inc (STI);.

--U.S. Bancorp (USB).

Fitch downgraded the Long- and Short-Term IDRs of Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) to 'A+'/'F1' from 'AA-'/'F1+', respectively. Fitch also downgraded Wells Fargo Bank, N.A .'s (WFBNA) Long-Term IDR to 'AA-' from 'AA'. WFBNA's Short-Term IDR was affirmed at 'F1+'. The rating action reflects Fitch's view of WFC's earnings profile, risk controls, and governance. Historically, WFC's above peer level ratings were primarily supported by its superior earnings profile and a risk management infrastructure that was viewed favourably, and steered the company well through the financial crisis. Nonetheless, Fitch does not believe WFC's earnings profile will exceed peer levels to the same degree it has in the past, and the agency acknowledges several notable missteps in WFC's risk controls and governance infrastructure that warranted the ratings downgrade. At WFC's new ratings levels, it remains one of the highest rated banks in the world, supported by its solid franchise, capital and liquidity profiles.

Fitch affirmed CMA's Long-term IDR at 'A' and revised the Rating Outlook to Stable from Negative. The Stable Outlook reflects the view that future credit costs related to the energy portfolio will likely remain contained and should not materially impact overall financial performance. Positively, the company has executed quickly on reducing energy exposure (direct and indirect lending) down to 4% for 2Q17 compared to 8% at 2Q15. CMA's ratings are also supported by the company's solid tangible capital base, strong funding profile, proven credit performance through various credit cycles and consistent performance. Although earnings performance has lagged peers for several years, over the last four quarters, CMA's profitability measures are trending at peer median levels. Fitch also recognizes that CMA's earnings profile is one of the most consistent.

Fitch also affirmed KEY's Long-term IDR at 'A-' and revised the Rating Outlook to Stable from Negative, reflecting Fitch's view that KEY has demonstrated successful progress with its integration of FNFG, including the targeted branch closures, the exiting of FNFG's over 200 third party vendor relationships, and integrating FNFG into KEY's platforms. KEY remains on track to execute on its financial targets announced at the acquisition and should benefit from revenue synergies. KEY's ratings are also supported by the company's strong capital position, solid asset quality performance, diversified revenue mix, and reduced risk profile

RF's ratings were upgraded to 'BBB+'/'F2' and its Rating Outlook revised to Stable from Positive, reflecting Fitch's view that RF's operating performance and overall financial condition have continued to converge with higher rated peers. The upgrade also reflects RF's strengthened risk management, evidenced by reasonable credit losses through the energy downturn and limited loan growth over recent periods.

Fitch downgraded Fifth Third Bancorp and Fifth Third Bank 's Long-term IDRs to 'A-' from 'A'/ Stable Outlook. Fitch also affirmed both bank's Short-term IDRs at 'F1'. These rating actions reflect earnings profiles that no longer outperform peers. Fitch still views FITB as a high quality bank, and in line with the large regional bank peer group average.

Fitch has published Rating Action Commentaries for each of the large regional banks, which are available at www.fitchratings.com. These include each issuer's key rating drivers and rating sensitivities and lists of all rating actions taken.

Press Release: Fitch Takes Rating Actions on Large Regional Banks Following Peer Review


 
 
The following is a press release from Fitch Ratings : 
 ","Fitch Ratings -Chicago-03 October 2017: Following its peer review of large regional banks, Fitch Ratings has taken various rating actions.

Fitch upgraded Regions Financial Corporation 's (RF) ratings to 'BBB+', and revised the bank's Rating Outlook to Stable from Positive. In addition, Fitch downgraded Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) and Wells Fargo & Company 's ratings and assigned both entities Stable Outlooks (WFC). Fitch affirmed the ratings on Comerica Incorporated (CMA) and KeyCorp (KEY) and revised their Outlooks to Stable from Negative.

Fitch affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) for the remaining large regional banks (listed below) in the peer review with Stable Outlooks.

--BB&T Corporation (BBT);

--Capital One Financial Corporation (COF);

--Citizens Financial Group (CFG);

--Huntington Bancshares Inc . (HBAN);

--M&T Bank Corporation (MTB);

--MUFG Americas Holding Corporation (MUAH);

--PNC Financial Services Group (PNC);

--SunTrust Banks, Inc (STI);.

--U.S. Bancorp (USB).

Fitch downgraded the Long- and Short-Term IDRs of Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) to 'A+'/'F1' from 'AA-'/'F1+', respectively. Fitch also downgraded Wells Fargo Bank, N.A .'s (WFBNA) Long-Term IDR to 'AA-' from 'AA'. WFBNA's Short-Term IDR was affirmed at 'F1+'. The rating action reflects Fitch's view of WFC's earnings profile, risk controls, and governance. Historically, WFC's above peer level ratings were primarily supported by its superior earnings profile and a risk management infrastructure that was viewed favourably, and steered the company well through the financial crisis. Nonetheless, Fitch does not believe WFC's earnings profile will exceed peer levels to the same degree it has in the past, and the agency acknowledges several notable missteps in WFC's risk controls and governance infrastructure that warranted the ratings downgrade. At WFC's new ratings levels, it remains one of the highest rated banks in the world, supported by its solid franchise, capital and liquidity profiles.

Fitch affirmed CMA's Long-term IDR at 'A' and revised the Rating Outlook to Stable from Negative. The Stable Outlook reflects the view that future credit costs related to the energy portfolio will likely remain contained and should not materially impact overall financial performance. Positively, the company has executed quickly on reducing energy exposure (direct and indirect lending) down to 4% for 2Q17 compared to 8% at 2Q15. CMA's ratings are also supported by the company's solid tangible capital base, strong funding profile, proven credit performance through various credit cycles and consistent performance. Although earnings performance has lagged peers for several years, over the last four quarters, CMA's profitability measures are trending at peer median levels. Fitch also recognizes that CMA's earnings profile is one of the most consistent.

Fitch also affirmed KEY's Long-term IDR at 'A-' and revised the Rating Outlook to Stable from Negative, reflecting Fitch's view that KEY has demonstrated successful progress with its integration of FNFG, including the targeted branch closures, the exiting of FNFG's over 200 third party vendor relationships, and integrating FNFG into KEY's platforms. KEY remains on track to execute on its financial targets announced at the acquisition and should benefit from revenue synergies. KEY's ratings are also supported by the company's strong capital position, solid asset quality performance, diversified revenue mix, and reduced risk profile

RF's ratings were upgraded to 'BBB+'/'F2' and its Rating Outlook revised to Stable from Positive, reflecting Fitch's view that RF's operating performance and overall financial condition have continued to converge with higher rated peers. The upgrade also reflects RF's strengthened risk management, evidenced by reasonable credit losses through the energy downturn and limited loan growth over recent periods.

Fitch downgraded Fifth Third Bancorp and Fifth Third Bank 's Long-term IDRs to 'A-' from 'A'/ Stable Outlook. Fitch also affirmed both bank's Short-term IDRs at 'F1'. These rating actions reflect earnings profiles that no longer outperform peers. Fitch still views FITB as a high quality bank, and in line with the large regional bank peer group average.

Fitch has published Rating Action Commentaries for each of the large regional banks, which are available at www.fitchratings.com. These include each issuer's key rating drivers and rating sensitivities and lists of all rating actions taken.

PLANO, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 03, 2017--

BOCES included Traversa in its 2017 software re-bid process because of the software's extreme popularity, allowing Tyler to be an approved vendor going forward.

""We are pleased to be recognized by the Board of Cooperative Education Services in New York for our Traversa student transportation software,"" said Ted Thien, vice president and general manager of Tyler's transportation solutions. ""We've already been able to provide our comprehensive system to several New York school districts, and we expect to bring fully-integrated student transportation functionality to additional clients because of the cooperative purchasing agreement.""

School districts receive funds from the state, called BOCES aid, for the shared services purchased the previous year.

Tyler offers a broad portfolio of school solutions in addition to transportation software, including data analytics, document management, incident management, student information, and financial management. Nationwide, Tyler has nearly 2,000 transportation clients.

Added Capabilities for Amazon EC2, IAM and Amazon S3 Protect Against Sensitive Data Loss; Prevent Malware Propagation and Security Misconfigurations","PR Newswire

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 3, 2017

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Palo Alto Networks (R) (NYSE: PANW), the next-generation security company, today announced that its Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) offering, Aperture(TM) SaaS security service, now provides application protections for several Amazon Web Services (AWS) solutions, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

The new protections address sensitive data loss, enable monitoring for risky or suspicious administrator behavior, and provide additional protection against security misconfigurations and malware propagation. When combined with the preventive capabilities of the Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Security Platform, these advancements will enable organizations to achieve even more protection for AWS, as well as address critical cloud security needs to deliver the most complete application and data security for cloud environments. Additionally, Aperture support for Office 365 and Google applications has been enhanced to include cloud-based email services and G Suite Marketplace applications.

Data and applications reside everywhere: on the network, on endpoints, and in the cloud. As part of the migration to the cloud, many enterprises are adopting a multi-cloud strategy that includes storing large amounts of business-critical data within cloud environments, which requires advanced protections that complement basic native cloud offering controls to achieve comprehensive and consistent security.

Palo Alto Networks Aperture controls enterprise SaaS applications and associated data by examining and controlling how data is shared, all without impact to user experience or changes to network infrastructure. If a policy violation occurs, Aperture enables quick enforcement of security policies to quarantine folders and data while immediately alerting security teams of suspicious behavior.

QUOTE 


   -- ""Our Aperture service secures business-critical data residing within 
      today's most important cloud-based enterprise SaaS applications. With 
      extensive capabilities across our security platform and our latest 
      application protections for Amazon Web Services , our customers benefit 
      from complete visibility and granular control, instant classification, 
      and enforcement across users, folders, and file activities, enabling them 
      to prevent cyber breaches and protect their data no matter where it 
      resides.""-   Lee Klarich , executive vice president, Product Management, 
      Palo Alto Networks  

Key new Aperture advancements introduced include: 


   -- Support for AWS: Aperture now provides additional in-cloud security 
      controls to prevent improper use while enabling malware protection and 
      data governance policies via integration with Amazon EC2, IAM and Amazon 
      S3. 
 
   -- Support extended to Office 365 Exchange: Aperture now adds the ability to 
      scan email content and attachments for compliance violations, malware, 
      user impersonation and data exposure within Office 365; this capability 
      also complements the company's existing integration with Proofpoint, 
      offering customers increased visibility and comprehensive protection 
      against advanced cyberthreats via email. 
 
   -- Controls for new productivity and file-sharing apps: Aperture already 
      offers protection for a number of business-critical SaaS applications, 
      such as Box, salesforce.com , Office 365 and many others; in addition to 
      Amazon EC2, IAM and Amazon S3, Aperture now supports several other 
      applications, including Citrix ShareFile(R), Atlassian  Confluence, G 
      Suite Marketplace applications, Jive(R), and Microsoft (R) Office 365 
      Exchange Server(R). 
 
   -- Policy control for G Suite Marketplace applications: Aperture can now 
      apply policy control across Marketplace applications, protecting 
      organizations from targeted phishing and malware attacks, or unwanted 
      data sharing, through the Google  G Suite Marketplace. 
 
   -- SIEM integrations with new API and log forwarding capability: Customers 
      can now configure Aperture to interface with syslog servers and API 
      clients, allowing them to push event information to external syslog 
      servers or access event information from the Aperture service via a REST 
      API. 
 
   -- Monitoring for suspicious user behavior: Aperture now supports the 
      ability to alert administrators if suspicious activity is detected within 
      SaaS applications.

Visa (NYSE:V) today announced Visa ID Intelligence, a platform that allows issuers, acquirers and merchants to quickly adopt emerging authentication technologies and create more secure and convenient ways for consumers to shop, pay and bank on their connected devices. Available through Visa Developer Platform, Visa ID Intelligence offers a curated selection of leading third-party authentication technologies with simple integration using Visa APIs and SDKs--allowing clients to create, test and adopt new authentication solutions.

The Internet of Things is expected to grow to 20 billion connected devices by 2020, exponentially expanding the devices and environments in which commerce can take place--from wearables, such as rings and watches, to home personal assistants and connected cars. Many of these devices are voice activated and not designed for typical passwords--requiring a new approach to authentication, such as face, fingerprint or voice recognition, document verification, or device and user identification. A 2017 Visa survey showed that 69 percent of US consumers believe that biometric authentication will make payments easier than using passwords.

""A consumer encounters many authentication moments during the course of a day, whether making a payment, checking a balance, or sending money to family and friends,"" said Mark Nelsen, senior vice president of risk and authentication products, Visa. ""But traditional methods for authenticating a customer can create frustration or are simply not designed for the new ways people are shopping and paying. We built Visa ID Intelligence to help accelerate smarter and easy-to-use authentication solutions for any commerce environment--to better protect against fraud and to move closer to a world without passwords.""

Recent Aite Group research found that, as the speed and complexity of fraud and cyberattacks increases, institutions and companies must look to nimble technology solutions that provide consumers with security as well as convenience. While many competitors offer solutions, not all of them are ideal for the payments industry and the high level of privacy, security and regulatory oversight that are required for financial transactions. Financial institutions and merchants can adopt effective and secure solutions and accelerate time-to-market with streamlined onboarding and implementation through Visa as a single trusted source. Visa has vetted technology providers to ensure they meet industry expectations for security and consumer privacy, including onsite Visa security assessments, penetration testing, and ongoing compliance audits. The platform also enables simplified contracting, saving clients potentially months of negotiations.

""Financial institutions and merchants are working hard to create streamlined and delightful digital experiences,"" said Julie Conroy , research director, retail banking practice, Aite Group . ""At the same time effective consumer authentication is critically important, given the escalating cyber threat landscape. The good news is that a variety of technologies can help businesses find the win-win, providing superior security while at the same time removing unnecessary friction.""

Authentication Capabilities

Today, Visa ID Intelligence features include: 


   -- Identity Documents -- evaluates identification documents and matches 
      selfies to photo IDs (e.g., driver's license, passport, military ID), 
      while extracting and converting document information into digital form. 
      This authentication process can help financial institutions or merchants 
      make smarter decisions and instantly provision banking services. Uses 
      include creating new accounts, and as an alternative to customer service 
      calls to perform password reset and lost or stolen card replacement. 
      Au10tix provides identity document services through the Visa ID 
      Intelligence platform. 
 
   -- Biometrics -- allows clients to use biometrics such as eyes, face, 
      fingerprint and voice to create simpler authentication experiences that 
      meet consumer needs for convenience, security and speed. Applications 
      include app login, payments, step-up authentication, and more. Daon, a 
      global authentication and identity assurance solutions provider, will 
      offer Visa ID Intelligence biometric authentication services. 

Visa ID Intelligence offerings will expand in 2018 to user data and device data to improve digital identity decisioning, working with Neustar and ThreatMetrix . More information about Visa ID Intelligence can be found at www.visaidintelligence.com.

     operations attributable to currency translation is calculated as the 
     difference between (a) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding 
     acquisition sales) and (b) the period-to-period change in revenue 
     (excluding acquisition sales) after applying current period foreign 
     exchange rates to the prior year period. We use the term ""core revenue 
     growth"" to refer to the measure of comparing current period core revenue 
     with the corresponding period of the prior year.

(B)  Gain on sale of investments in nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 
     ($223 million pretax as presented in this line item, $140 million 
     after-tax). 
 
(C)  Charge for early extinguishment of borrowings for the nine-month period 
     ended September 30, 2016 ($179 million pretax as presented in this line 
     item, $112 million after-tax). 
 
(D)  Gain on resolution of acquisition-related matters for the nine-month 
     period ended September 30, 2016 ($18 million pretax as presented in this 
     line item, $14 million after-tax). 
 
(E)  During the nine-month period ended September 29, 2017, the Company 
     recorded $76 million of pretax restructuring, impairment and other 
     related charges ($51 million after-tax) primarily related to the 
     Company's strategic decision to discontinue a molecular diagnostic 
     product line in its Diagnostics segment. As a result, the Company 
     incurred noncash charges for the impairment of certain technology-related 
     intangibles as well as related inventory and plant, property and 
     equipment with no further use totaling $49 million. In addition, the 
     Company incurred cash restructuring costs primarily related to employee 
     severance and related charges totaling $27 million. This is addressed in 
     more detail in the ""Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Measures."" 
 
(F)  This line item reflects the aggregate tax effect of all nontax 
     adjustments reflected in the table above. In addition, the footnotes 
     above indicate the after-tax amount of each individual adjustment 
     item. Danaher estimates the tax effect of the adjustment items identified 
     in the reconciliation schedule above by applying Danaher's overall 
     estimated effective tax rate to the pretax amount, unless the nature of 
     the item and/or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded 
     requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment, in which 
     case the tax effect of such item is estimated by applying such specific 
     tax rate or tax treatment. 
 
(G)  Represents (1) discrete income tax gains, primarily related to expiration 
     of statute of limitations ($35 million in the nine-month period ended 
     September 29, 2017), (2) equity compensation-related excess tax benefits 
     ($16 million in the nine-month period ended September 29, 2017) and (3) 
     Fortive separation-related tax costs related to repatriation of earnings, 
     legal entity realignments and other discrete matters ($99 million in the 
     nine-month period ended September 30, 2016). On January 1, 2017, Danaher 
     adopted the updated accounting guidance required by ASU 2016-09, 
     Compensation--Stock Compensation, which requires income statement 
     recognition of all excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to equity 
     compensation. We exclude from Adjusted Diluted Net EPS any excess tax 
     benefits that exceed the levels we believe are representative of 
     historical experience. In the first quarter of 2017, we anticipated $10 
     million of equity compensation-related excess tax benefits and realized 
     $26 million of excess tax benefits, and therefore we have excluded $16 
     million of these benefits in the calculation of Adjusted Diluted Net 
     Earnings per Share. In the second and third quarters of 2017, realized

     equity compensation-related excess tax benefits approximated the 
     anticipated benefit and no adjustments were required. 
 

Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Measures

Each of the non-GAAP measures set forth above should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measure, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing Danaher Corporation 's (""Danaher"" or the ""Company"") results that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, help our investors to: 


   -- with respect to Adjusted Diluted Net EPS, understand the long-term 
      profitability trends of our business and compare our profitability to 
      prior and future periods and to our peers; and 
   -- with respect to core revenue, identify underlying growth trends in our 
      business and compare our revenue performance with prior and future 
      periods and to our peers. 

Management uses these non-GAAP measures to measure the Company's operating and financial performance, and uses a non-GAAP measure similar to Adjusted Diluted Net EPS in the Company's executive compensation program.

The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures set forth above have been excluded for the following reasons: 


   -- With respect to Adjusted Diluted Net EPS: 
 
   -- We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 
      because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted 
      by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we 
      consummate.  While we have a history of significant acquisition activity 
      we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an 
      acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related 
      amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary 
      significantly from acquisition to acquisition.  Exclusion of this 
      amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating 
      results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, 
      and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies.  We believe 
      however that it is important for investors to understand that such 
      intangible assets contribute to revenue generation and that intangible 
      asset amortization related to past acquisitions will recur in future 
      periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. 
 
   -- We exclude costs incurred pursuant to discrete restructuring plans that 
      are fundamentally different (in terms of the size, strategic nature and 
      planning requirements, as well as the inconsistent frequency, of such 
      plans) from the ongoing productivity improvements that result from 
      application of the Danaher Business System.  Because these restructuring 
      plans are incremental to the core activities that arise in the ordinary 
      course of our business and we believe are not indicative of Danaher's 
      ongoing operating costs in a given period, we exclude these costs from 
      the calculation of Adjusted Diluted Net EPS to facilitate a more 
      consistent comparison of operating results over time. 
 
   -- With respect to the other items excluded from Adjusted Diluted Net EPS, 
      we exclude these items because they are of a nature and/or size that 
      occur with inconsistent frequency, occur for reasons that may be 
      unrelated to Danaher's commercial performance during the period and/or we 
      believe are not indicative of Danaher's ongoing operating costs or gains 
      in a given period; we believe that such items may obscure underlying 
      business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. 
   -- With respect to core revenue, (1) we exclude the impact of currency 
      translation because it is not under management's control, is subject to 
      volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and (2) we exclude 
      the effect of acquisitions and divested product lines because the timing, 
      size, number and nature of such transactions can vary significantly from 
      period-to-period and between us and our peers, which we believe may 
      obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term 
      performance difficult.

ATLANTA, Oct. 19, 2017

ATLANTA, Oct. 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Genuine Parts Company (NYSE: GPC) announced today sales and earnings for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2017.

Sales for the third quarter ended September 30, 2017 were $4.1 billion, a 4% increase compared to $3.9 billion for the same period in 2016. Net income for the third quarter was $158.4 million compared to $185.3 million recorded for the same period in the previous year. Earnings per share on a diluted basis were $1.08 compared to $1.24 in the third quarter last year. Before the impact of certain transaction costs primarily related to the Company's pending $2.0 billion European acquisition recorded in the third quarter of 2017, adjusted net income was $170 million, or $1.16 per diluted share.

Third quarter sales for the Automotive Group were up 3.6% including an approximate 1% comparable sales increase. Sales at Motion Industries , the Industrial Group, were up 7.1%, including a 4% comparable sales increase, and sales at EIS, the Electrical/Electronic Group, grew 11.6%, with comparable sales down 1%. Sales for S.P. Richards, the Office Products Group, were down 4.7% for the quarter in both total and comparable sales.

Paul Donahue , President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, ""The third quarter presented us with both opportunities and challenges. We were excited to announce our entry into Europe with the pending acquisition of one of the leading automotive distributors in that region, Alliance Automotive Group, which we expect to close in November. While, domestically, we continued to operate in a challenging sales environment across three of the key industries we serve, U.S. Automotive, Office and Electrical, our Industrial and international Automotive businesses produced stronger year over year growth. In total, we generated a 4% total sales increase, despite one less billing day in the quarter and the disruption from unprecedented natural disasters, including hurricanes and earthquakes. This was achieved via organic growth of 1%, 2% from acquisitions and a 1% foreign exchange benefit.""

Mr. Donahue added, ""Our third quarter profitability was impacted by lower gross margin and higher operating expenses, as our initiatives to drive margin expansion did not meet our expectations. To that point, our plans and initiatives are underway to expedite corrective action.""

Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 were $12.1 billion, a 4.7% increase compared to $11.6 billion for the same period in 2016. Net income for the nine months was $509 million compared to $535 million in 2016, and earnings per share on a diluted basis were $3.44 compared to $3.56 in 2016. Before the transaction costs recorded in the third quarter of 2017 noted above, adjusted net income was $520 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $3.52.

Mr. Donahue concluded, ""We enter the fourth quarter focused on generating stronger organic sales growth as well as maximizing the benefits of our acquisitions. We are also intensely focused on the plans and initiatives underway to cut costs and improve our profitability. While we are disappointed with this quarter's results, we are excited about the opportunities ahead and we move forward with a deep sense of urgency as we focus on maximizing shareholder value and positioning the Company for long-term success.""

2017 Outlook

For the full year 2017, the Company is increasing its sales guidance from up 3% to 4% to up 4% to 4.5%. The Company is also updating diluted earnings per share to range from $4.47 to $4.52 and adjusted diluted earnings per share to range from $4.55 to $4.60. This compares to the prior outlook of $4.70 to $4.75. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes any fourth quarter 2017 revenue, earnings or expenses, including transaction costs, associated with the pending acquisition of Alliance Automotive Group, as well as the transaction costs recorded in the third quarter of 2017 noted above.

Conference Call

Genuine Parts Company will hold a conference call today at 11:00 a.m. EDT to discuss the results of the quarter and the future outlook. Interested parties may listen to the call on the Company's website, www.genpt.com, by clicking ""Investors"", or by dialing 877-857-6161, conference ID 8518758.

Xcelium simulator delivers 2X performance speedup on mixed-signal design for test market","PR Newswire

SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 10, 2017

SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Cadence Design Systems, Inc . (NASDAQ: CDNS) today announced that Teradyne Inc . has standardized its simulation tasks using the Xcelium(TM) Parallel Logic Simulator to accelerate ASIC development for delivery of its automation equipment for test and industrial applications. With the Xcelium simulator, Teradyne achieved a 2X performance speedup with production-use single-core, mixed-signal ASIC verification when compared with its previous simulation solution.

Teradyne, a longtime user of the broader Cadence(R) Verification Suite, built a verification environment that can deliver first-pass silicon success with mixed-signal designs, accelerating time to market. The Xcelium simulator has quickly become a key component in the verification environment, providing the Teradyne team with an easy-to-use solution that delivers fast simulation performance and ensures high-quality designs. With Teradyne's extensive use of real number models, the Xcelium simulator allows its designers to perform earlier, more complete full-chip mixed-signal verification. In addition to using the Xcelium simulator, Teradyne is also utilizing the Cadence JasperGold(R) Formal Verification Platform to assist with formal-first verification and expedited debug, and the Cadence vManager(TM) Metric-Driven Signoff Platform to effectively integrate the verification process from planning to metrics management across formal, simulation, emulation and verification IP.

""Rapid development and verification of our automation test equipment solutions is critical to our success,"" said Andre Hendarman, Director of Mixed Signal ASIC Development at Teradyne, Inc . ""The Xcelium Parallel Logic Simulator has provided us with the fastest simulation performance by far, which is helping us speed up the delivery of our test products, while also ensuring our designs are of the highest quality.""

The new Xcelium simulator further extends the innovation within the Cadence Verification Suite and supports the company's System Design Enablement strategy, which enables system and semiconductor companies to create complete, differentiated end products more efficiently.

Press Release: Fitch Rates Conagra Brands, Inc.'s Approximately $500MM Debt Issuance 'BBB'; Outlook Stable


 
 
The following is a press release from Fitch Ratings : 
 ","Fitch Ratings-New York-10 October 2017: Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to Conagra Brands, Inc .'s approximately $500 million floating-rate senior unsecured note offering. The notes rank pari passu with its existing senior unsecured debt, and will mature in October 2020. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper at maturity and the repurchase of common stock. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release.

Conagra 's rating recognizes the company's evolution to a business model that aligns with other large U.S. packaged food companies. Following a series of divestitures, Conagra has emerged as a pure-play portfolio of branded products. Operating margins have increased from low double-digits to mid-double-digits. The company is investing in product innovation and marketing and the results are reflected in the improved performance of its brands such as Healthy Choice. Fitch believes Conagra could stabilize sales beginning in late fiscal 2018 after several years of declines and expects the company to maintain leverage under 3x.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Transition to Pure-Play, Branded Packaged Food Firm: Conagra has transitioned to a pure-play, branded packaged food company over the course of 2016 and 2017 by divesting and spinning off its private brand and commercial businesses. In July 2015, the company announced plans to sell its private label Ralcorp business (fiscal 2015 sales of approximately $4 billion and EBITDA of $370 million), which was acquired in January 2013, but had under-performed expectations. In February 2016, the company completed the sale to Tree House Foods, Inc., for $2.6 billion in cash.

The company also generated approximately $489 million in net proceeds from the July 2016 sale of two of its commercial businesses, Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings and JM Swank . In November 2016, the company completed the separation of Conagra Foods, Inc . into two publicly traded companies, Conagra Brands, Inc . and Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc . (Lamb Weston ), a frozen potato business which was Conagra's remaining commercial business, through a tax free spin-off. Lamb Weston generated approximately $3 billion in revenues and $593 million in EBITDA in fiscal 2016. Following the spinoff, Conagra received a cash distribution of $823.5 million and retired $1.4 billion in debt. Conagra used a majority of the proceeds from these transactions to pay down debt and ended fiscal 2017 (May 2017) with leverage of 1.9x compared to 3.6x in fiscal 2015. More recently, in May 2017, Conagra announced the proposed sale of its Wesson Oil brand for $285 million.

Well Defined Acquisition Strategy: Concurrently the company defined an acquisition strategy that focuses on 'modernizing' transactions and 'synergistic' acquisitions. Modernizing transactions are smaller and consistent with emerging trends in food. Modernizing transactions are platforms for future growth but may not be immediately impactful. Conagra has closed several of these acquisitions over the past two years: Blake's All Natural Food, Frontera Foods, and Duke's meat snacks / BIGS seeds. None of these acquisitions were more than $220 million. In September 2017, Conagra announced its acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC , a company selling popcorn and other snack items. These transactions tend to focus on premium food brands that accommodate changing consumer preferences and reorient the brand mix towards artisanal, specialty, natural and organic options. Synergistic acquisitions are larger, enhance Conagra's network and can bring new capabilities to the company. Conagra 's recent acquisitions all fall into the Modernizing bucket.

Margin Enhancement Initiatives Underway: Conagra 's EBIT margins have grown steadily over the past two years as the company has shifted from being volume-driven to being value-oriented. Fitch adjusted EBIT margins, which were 13.8% in fiscal 2016, improved to 16.2% in fiscal 2017. In addition to resetting its volume base at higher price points, Conagra is implementing an Integrated Margin Management strategy, which focuses on mitigating inflation risk. On the operating cost front, the company completed a $200 million SG&A savings program and is on track to complete its $100 million trade efficiency program. These initiatives focus on cost-saving opportunities in procurement, manufacturing, logistics, and customer service, as well as general and administrative overhead levels. Furthermore, Conagra is working to increase margins by upgrading its portfolio. For example, the company announced the proposed divesture of its Wesson oils brand, a low margin business with significant private label activity.

Customer Concentration Risk: In recent years, competition in the packaged food industry has intensified, and consolidation in the grocery and foodservice industries has led to increased negotiating power for Conagra's customers, pressuring profit margins. In fiscal 2017, Wal-Mart (including Sam's) accounted for 24% of Conagra's total net sales (in-line with Walmart 's 24% food market share in North America), but no other customer accounted for more than 10% of its net sales. The grocery industry is consolidating and evolving. The pressure on food companies, like Conagra, is reflective of this consolidation and the threat of the European hard discount grocers, which focus more on private brands, entering and further investing in the U.S. market. In June 2017, Aldi announced that it would be investing a total of $5 billion over the next five years to remodel and expand its U.S. store base. Lidl opened its first U.S. store in June 2017. Walmart has responded by testing lower prices and further pressuring food suppliers, including Conagra, for better terms and lower prices. Kroger , the #2 player in the food retail industry, in turn, has stepped up its efforts to remain price competitive.

The other game changer is Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods, Inc. Currently, online grocery sales in the U.S. are in the low-single-digits as a percent of sales. However, this penetration may increase given that the Whole Foods acquisition gives Amazon a hard-to-replicate refrigerated supply chain that can be used as a base for home deliveries. In addition, Fitch expects the Amazon/Whole Foods combination to result in further downward pressure on food prices given Amazon's history of driving down prices in other industries.

Leverage Expected to be Sustained below 3x: As noted, Conagra ended fiscal 2017 with leverage of 1.9x compared with leverage of 3.6x in fiscal 2015 as it used its proceeds from Lamb-Weston and the divestitures to reduce debt from $7.9 billion to $3 billion (Fitch adjusted) in fiscal 2017. Fitch assumes share buyback of $1.1 billion in fiscal 2018, based upon company guidance, which will bring leverage to mid-2x. Total leverage is expected to remain below 3x over the next 36 months, barring a significant acquisition. To the extent that Conagra does a transformative acquisition, Fitch would expect leverage to return to below 3x within the next 24 to 36 months.

DERIVATION SUMMARY

Over the past two years, Conagra has transitioned into a pure play, branded, packaged food company after its divestitures of its commercial businesses including Lamb Weston , Spicetec Flavours & Seasonings and JM Swank businesses along with Conagra's private label business. Concurrently the company defined an acquisition strategy focusing on smaller 'modernizing' companies along with larger 'synergistic' targets. Conagra also has implemented a margin enhancement program. The IDR upgrade to 'BBB' from 'BBB-' reflects Conagra's cost structure initiatives and a significant upgrade in its portfolio composition, which together have resulted in improved margins and higher profitability measures. Risks to the business could result if Conagra's investment in portfolio innovation does not result in a stabilization of revenue as contemplated and its margins suffer as food retailers exert more pressure on the food manufacturers than currently expected.

General Mills (BBB+/ Negative) had annual revenue of $15.6 billion and was levered at 2.8x total Debt/EBITDA as of May 2017. Kraft Heinz (BBB-/Stable) had annual revenue of $26 billion, industry-leading EBITDA margin of approximately 29%, and was levered at 4.3x total Debt/EBITDA as of December 2016. Kellogg (BBB/Stable) had annual revenue of $13 billion and was levered at 3.3x total Debt/EBITDA as of December 2016. Mondelez (BBB/Stable) had annual revenue of $25.9 billion and was levered at 3.7x total Debt/EBITDA as of December 2016.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include:

--Revenue is expected to decline at a low-single-digit rate in FY2018 before stabilizing and growing at low-single-digit rates in the forecast out years. Fitch assumed yearly bolt-on acquisitions that are growing at a faster pace than Conagra's organic business;

--Gross margin is expected to trend towards 32% by FY2020;

--EBIT margin is expected to be maintained above 15% throughout the forecast period;

--EBITDA is expected to remain steady in the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion range;

--Capex is assumed to be in the range of 3% to 4% of net sales;

--FCF (after dividends) is expected to be in the range of $350 million to $400 million annually over the next 24-36 months. Fitch expects this to be directed towards the company's share buyback program but could also be used for bolt-on acquisitions;

--Fitch assumed share buy-back of $1.1 billion in FY2018, which will bring leverage to mid-2x;

--Total debt/EBITDA is expected to be sustained below the 3x level.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action

10 Oct 2017 10:30 ET 
Press Release: Fitch Rates Conagra Brands, Inc.'s -2-

--Execution of the company's strategic plan with low-single-digit organic growth that is in line with, or better than category growth with overall market shares stable or improving and operating margins remain in line with the industry average in the mid-teens or above;

--Leverage (Total debt/EBITDA) sustained below 3x.

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action

--The company loses momentum, leading to sustained top-line weakness and potential market share loss in major categories;

--Leverage moving toward mid-3x as a result of poor performance, material debt-financed share buybacks or acquisitions.

LIQUIDITY

Ample Liquidity, Manageable Maturities: Conagra maintains an undrawn $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that provides backup for its commercial paper program. The company had $323.2 million outstanding in its CP program and $251.4 million cash as of Aug. 27, 2017. The majority of this cash, $244.5 million, was held in foreign countries. Total debt was approximately $3.3 billion as of Aug. 27, 2017.

Conagra Brands, Inc .

--Long-Term IDR 'BBB';

--Short-Term IDR 'F2';

      friendly and lessen pilot workload. These displays also offer scalable 
      window views, charts, maps and aircraft system details that make glancing 
      across controls effortless. 
 
   -- Better information and mandate ready. Primus Epic 2.0 includes the latest 
      communication systems, providing operators with an easy path to the 
      mandated Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out system. The 
      system also supports Cockpit Display of Traffic Information, which 
      combines a map view with location information on other aircraft in a 
      plane's vicinity, while in the air or on the ground. 
 
   -- Honeywell  as your sole supplier. The new cockpit avoids the headache of 
      difficult maintenance and upgrade processes by letting pilots and 
      operators rely on Honeywell  as their sole supplier for all cockpit 
      avionics solutions.

PR Newswire

MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., Oct. 10, 2017

MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., Oct. 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced the results of its comprehensive portfolio review, including its intention to separately spin off its Homes product portfolio and ADI global distribution business, as well as its Transportation Systems business, into two stand-alone, publicly-traded companies. The planned separation transactions are intended to be tax-free spins to Honeywell shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are expected to be completed by the end of 2018.

""Today's announcement marks the culmination of a rigorous portfolio review involving a detailed assessment of every Honeywell business. As part of that review, we analyzed numerous criteria, including growth outlook, financial performance, market dynamics, potential for disruption, and, most importantly, assessment of fit as a Honeywell business,"" said Honeywell President and CEO Darius Adamczyk . ""The remaining Honeywell portfolio will consist of high-growth businesses in six attractive industrial end markets, each aligned to global mega trends including energy efficiency, infrastructure investment, urbanization and safety. These businesses are best positioned to leverage Honeywell synergies from our technologies, financial and business models, and talent. Our simplified portfolio will offer multiple platforms for organic growth and margin expansion through further deployment of our world-class HOS Gold operating system and the Honeywell Sentience Platform. Honeywell will also have multiple levers for continuing to execute an aggressive capital deployment strategy, including a vigorous and disciplined M&A program.

""The spun businesses will be better positioned to maximize shareowner value through focused strategic decision making and capital allocation tailored for their end markets,"" Adamczyk said.

""At Honeywell , we will continue our track record of execution, delivering growth, margin expansion, and aggressive capital allocation for our shareowners.""

The new Homes and Global Distribution business will be a leader in the home heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) controls and security markets, and a leading global distributor of security and fire protection products. The business is expected to have annualized revenue of approximately $4.5 billion, a high-yield credit rating, approximately 13,000 employees, and financial responsibility for certain Honeywell legacy liabilities.

The new Transportation Systems business will be a global leader in turbocharger technologies with best-in-class engineering capabilities for a broad range of engine types across global automobile, truck and other vehicle markets. The business is expected to have annualized revenue of approximately $3 billion, a high-yield credit rating, approximately 6,500 employees and financial responsibility for Honeywell legacy automotive segment liabilities in an amount equal to our Bendix legacy asbestos liability.

The planned separations will not require a shareowner vote. Each spin-off will be subject to finalization of the contours of the spun-off business, assurance that the separation will be tax-free to Honeywell shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes, finalization of the capital structure of the three corporations, the effectiveness of appropriate filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , final approval of the Honeywell Board of Directors, and other customary matters.

Company Previews Anticipated Strong Third-Quarter Results; Raises Low-End of Full-Year Guidance

Honeywell announced it anticipates strong third-quarter results. Sales are expected to be $10.1 billion, up 3% reported and up 5% organic, and earnings per share is expected to be $1.75, up 9% reported and up 16%(1) ex-divestitures, normalized for tax at 26%, driven by strong results at its Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies business groups. The Company also raised the low-end of its full-year 2017 earnings per share guidance by 5 cents to a new range of $7.05 - $7.10, excluding any pension mark-to-market adjustment. The Company will hold its quarterly earnings announcement on Friday, October 20, at 9:30 a.m. EDT.

New Leader Appointed for Home and Building Technologies Business Group

Effective immediately, Gary Michel will serve as president and CEO of Honeywell's Home and Building Technologies (HBT) strategic business group. Michel will report to Adamczyk and serve as a company officer. Michel succeeds Terrence Hahn, who will move to a leadership role reporting to Adamczyk and will help prepare the Homes and ADI businesses for the spin.

Michel joins Honeywell from Ingersoll-Rand Company , where he has held a series of large leadership roles over the past 32 years. Most recently, he served as senior vice president and president, Residential HVAC and Supply, which he transformed to deliver substantial improvements in revenue and market share, operating income, commercialization processes, and technology platforms. Michel has also led Ingersoll-Rand 's Club Car; Road Development - Construction Technologies; and Utility Equipment - Construction Technologies businesses. Michel has held several other roles, including executive director, Corporate Development, and general manager, Aftermarket Division, for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Michel earned his B.S. in mechanical engineering at Virginia Tech and his M.B.A. at the University of Phoenix .

""Gary has proven himself to be an innovative and energetic leader with a deep understanding of his customers and end markets and the ability to translate this knowledge into technology-differentiated offerings that bring value to customers,"" Adamczyk said. ""Gary is a welcome addition to our team and will help Honeywell continue to be a leader in connected technologies, building on our great positions in growing industries.""

Smart Energy Business to Align with Performance Materials and Technologies

In addition, Honeywell 's Smart Energy business unit, previously part of HBT, will immediately be integrated into the Process Solutions unit within Honeywell Performance Materials and Technologies. Honeywell Smart Energy enables utilities and distribution companies to deploy advanced capabilities that transform operations, improve reliability and environmental sustainability, and better serve customers.

(1) Earnings per share attributable to 2016 divestitures utilizes 
weighted average shares of 774.4 million and a blended tax rate of 32.9% 
for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
(2) The Company has and continues to have an ongoing level of 
restructuring activities, for which there is a planned amount of 
restructuring-related charges. Additional restructuring represents only 
amounts that are incremental to those planned restructuring amounts. For 
the three months ended September 30, 2017, the Company funded 
approximately $100 million of restructuring, approximately $60 million 
of which was incremental to the planned amount. This additional 
restructuring was enabled by a lower than expected effective tax rate 
for the period. We believe that the exclusion of this additional 
restructuring provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year 
results. Earnings per share attributable to additional restructuring 
uses a tax rate of 26% for the three months ended September 30, 2017. 
 
We believe earnings per share adjusted to normalize for the expected 
effective tax rate of 26% for the most recently completed fiscal quarter 
(as presented in prior guidance for such quarter) and to exclude the 
2016 divestitures is a measure that is useful to investors and 
management in understanding our ongoing operations and in analysis of 
ongoing operating trends.

2017-10-10,CVX,Press Release: Keyera Announces Long-Term Duvernay Natural Gas Liquids Agreement With Chevron,"Keyera Announces Long-Term Duvernay Natural Gas Liquids Agreement With Chevron

Canada NewsWire","CALGARY, Oct. 10, 2017

CALGARY, Oct. 10, 2017 /CNW/ - Keyera Corp . (TSX:KEY) (""Keyera"") today announced that it has entered into a 20-year midstream agreement (the ""Agreement"") with Chevron Canada Limited (""Chevron "") to fractionate and handle natural gas liquids from Chevron 's Kaybob Duvernay operations near Fox Creek, Alberta. The Agreement includes an area of dedication that is in excess of 230,000 gross operated acres and also includes take-or-pay commitments. Under the terms of the Agreement, Chevron will deliver approximately 50% of its natural gas liquids from the area of dedication to Keyera for fractionation, storage and terminalling services on a fee-for-service basis.

Upon Chevron 's request during the term of the Agreement, Keyera will provide such services through individual long-term service agreements. Keyera expects to provide the requested services through its fractionation, storage and terminalling assets at its Keyera Fort Saskatchewan energy complex. Depending on the success and scale of Chevron 's Duvernay program, Keyera may need to expand its facilities in the future.

""We are pleased to have been selected by Chevron to provide NGL midstream solutions, highlighting our commitment to provide reliable and competitive services with a focus on our customers' needs,"" said Dean Setoguchi, Keyera's Senior Vice President of the Liquids Business Unit. ""With Chevron being one of the largest lease holders in the Duvernay resource play, the Agreement represents an exciting opportunity for Keyera. We look forward to working with Chevron in a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship.""

2017-10-27,EMN,Press Release: Eastman Announces Third-Quarter 2017 Financial Results,,"
 
 
   KINGSPORT, Tenn., October 26, 2017 - Eastman Chemical Company  (NYSE:EMN) 
today announced reported earnings of $2.22 per diluted share for third 
quarter 2017 versus $1.56 per diluted share for third quarter 2016.

versus $1.86 per diluted share for third quarter 2016. For detail of the

   ""Once again, we delivered outstanding year-over-year growth in adjusted

specialties continued their strong performance, marked by exceptional 
growth in Additives & Functional Products,"" said Mark Costa , Board Chair

tremendous capability and determination of the Eastman team.""

items in 3Q 2017 and 2016, and reconciliation to reported company and 
segment earnings, see Tables 3A and 4A. 
 
   Segment Results 3Q 2017 versus 3Q 2016 
 
   Additives & Functional Products - Sales revenue increased primarily due 
to higher sales volume for most product lines. Operating earnings 
increased primarily due to higher sales volume. 
 
   Advanced Materials - Sales revenue increased due to improved product mix 
from higher sales volume of premium products. Operating earnings were 
unchanged compared to record earnings in the year ago period. 
 
   Chemical Intermediates - Sales revenue increased due to higher selling 
prices attributed to higher raw material prices and continued 
improvement in competitive conditions. Operating earnings increased 
primarily due to higher selling prices, lower commodity hedge levels, 
and lower operating costs, partially offset by higher raw material and 
energy costs. 
 
   Fibers - Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices, 
particularly for acetate tow, attributed to lower industry capacity 
utilization rates. Operating earnings declined due to lower selling 
prices, partially offset by lower operating costs resulting from recent 
actions. 
 
   Cash Flow 
 
   Eastman generated $528 million in cash from operating activities during 
third quarter 2017 primarily due to strong net earnings. Total 
borrowings decreased $187 million and share repurchases totaled $100 
million during the quarter. 
 
   In first nine months 2017, the company generated cash from operations of 
over $1 billion and $573 million of free cash flow (defined as cash from 
operating activities minus capital expenditures). In addition, the 
company returned $498 million to stockholders with $275 million of share 
repurchases and $223 million of dividends. The company continues to 
expect to generate approximately $1 billion of free cash flow in 2017. 
 
   See Tables 5A, 5B and 6A. Priorities for uses of available cash include 
payment of the quarterly dividend, repayment of debt, funding targeted 
growth initiatives, and repurchasing shares. 
 
   Kingsport Coal Gasification Operational Incident 
 
   As previously announced, on October 4, 2017 an explosion in the 
Kingsport site's coal gasification area disrupted manufacturing 
operations. There were no serious injuries and no impact to the 
environment. All manufacturing operations have resumed except for coal 
gasification. Due to the unique advantages of our scale and integration, 
the company has made excellent progress in repairing the facility and 
implemented alternate processes to maintain operations of downstream 
derivative facilities of coal gasification. We expect the coal 
gasification area to be operable by the end of fourth quarter 2017. This, 
along with our mitigating actions, is expected to enable full production 
of acetyl chemicals and derivatives. Normal operations are expected to 
resume in early 2018. 
 
   While the company continues to assess the financial impact of the 
incident, the net impact is expected to reduce operating earnings by 
between $50 and $100 million. Costs in fourth quarter 2017 related to 
the incident are expected to be approximately $100 million, partially 
offset by insurance recovery expected in first half 2018. 
 
   Outlook 
 
 
 
   Commenting on the outlook for full-year 2017, Costa said: ""Our excellent 
third-quarter results build on the strong performance we have delivered 
throughout the year.  We continue to create our own growth with 
innovative, high margin products in what remains an uncertain global 
business environment. Capital allocation and cost management are also 
contributing to earnings growth. As a result, our expectations for 
adjusted 2017 EPS growth have improved to be solidly at the high end of 
the previously projected range of 10 to 12 percent compared with 2016, 
excluding the financial impact of the Kingsport operational incident."" 
 
   The full-year 2017 projected earnings exclude any non-core, unusual, or 
non-recurring items in fourth quarter 2017, assumes that the adjusted 
tax rate detailed in Tables 4A and 4B for first nine months 2017 will be 
the actual rate for full-year 2017, and excludes the financial impact of 
the Kingsport operational incident. Our 2017 financial results forecasts 
do not include non-core items (such as mark-to-market pension and other 
postretirement benefit gain or loss) or any unusual or non-recurring 
items, and we accordingly are unable to reconcile projected full-year 
2017 earnings excluding non-core and any unusual or non-recurring items 
to reported GAAP earnings without unreasonable efforts. 
 
   Forward-Looking Statements 
 
   This news release includes forward-looking statements concerning current 
expectations and assumptions for future global economic conditions; 
competitive position and acceptance of specialty products in key 
markets; mix of products sold; raw material and energy prices and costs,

2017. Such expectations and assumptions are based upon certain 
preliminary information, internal estimates, and management assumptions, 
expectations, and plans, and are subject to a number of risks and 
uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions, events, and 
results. Actual results could differ materially from expectations and 
assumptions expressed in the forward-looking statements if one or more 
of the underlying assumptions or expectations prove to be inaccurate or 
are unrealized. Important factors that could cause actual results to 
differ materially from such expectations are and will be detailed in the 
company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission , including 
the Form 10-Q filed for second quarter 2017 available, and the Form 10-Q 
to be filed for third quarter 2017 and to be available, on the Eastman 
web site at www.eastman.com in the Investors, SEC  filings section, and

Press Release: Eastman Announces Third-Quarter 2017 Financial Results


 
 
   KINGSPORT, Tenn., October 26, 2017 - Eastman Chemical Company  (NYSE:EMN) 
today announced reported earnings of $2.22 per diluted share for third 
quarter 2017 versus $1.56 per diluted share for third quarter 2016. 
Adjusted earnings were $2.19 per diluted share for third quarter 2017 
versus $1.86 per diluted share for third quarter 2016. For detail of the 
adjustments and reconciliation to reported company and segment earnings 
for all periods presented, see Tables 3A and 4A. 
 
   ""Once again, we delivered outstanding year-over-year growth in adjusted 
EPS, reflecting the strength of our portfolio as well as our ability to 
leverage solid underlying business conditions for growth. Our 
specialties continued their strong performance, marked by exceptional 
growth in Additives & Functional Products,"" said Mark Costa , Board Chair 
and CEO. ""Over the past several weeks, we have also responded with 
extraordinary professionalism and decisiveness as we faced hurricanes in 
the U.S. and the coal gasification incident at our Kingsport facility. 
With both of these challenges, our ability to minimize disruption and 
reduce impact is a testament to our scale, vertical integration, and the 
tremendous capability and determination of the Eastman team.""

   *For adjusted provision for income taxes in 3Q 2017, excluded non-core 
items in 3Q 2017 and 2016, and reconciliation to reported company and 
segment earnings, see Tables 3A and 4A. 
 
   Segment Results 3Q 2017 versus 3Q 2016 
 
   Additives & Functional Products - Sales revenue increased primarily due 
to higher sales volume for most product lines. Operating earnings 
increased primarily due to higher sales volume. 
 
   Advanced Materials - Sales revenue increased due to improved product mix 
from higher sales volume of premium products. Operating earnings were 
unchanged compared to record earnings in the year ago period. 
 
   Chemical Intermediates - Sales revenue increased due to higher selling 
prices attributed to higher raw material prices and continued 
improvement in competitive conditions. Operating earnings increased 
primarily due to higher selling prices, lower commodity hedge levels, 
and lower operating costs, partially offset by higher raw material and 
energy costs. 
 
   Fibers - Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices, 
particularly for acetate tow, attributed to lower industry capacity 
utilization rates. Operating earnings declined due to lower selling 
prices, partially offset by lower operating costs resulting from recent 
actions. 
 
   Cash Flow 
 
   Eastman generated $528 million in cash from operating activities during 
third quarter 2017 primarily due to strong net earnings. Total 
borrowings decreased $187 million and share repurchases totaled $100 
million during the quarter. 
 
   In first nine months 2017, the company generated cash from operations of 
over $1 billion and $573 million of free cash flow (defined as cash from 
operating activities minus capital expenditures). In addition, the 
company returned $498 million to stockholders with $275 million of share 
repurchases and $223 million of dividends. The company continues to 
expect to generate approximately $1 billion of free cash flow in 2017. 
 
   See Tables 5A, 5B and 6A. Priorities for uses of available cash include 
payment of the quarterly dividend, repayment of debt, funding targeted 
growth initiatives, and repurchasing shares. 
 
   Kingsport Coal Gasification Operational Incident 
 
   As previously announced, on October 4, 2017 an explosion in the 
Kingsport site's coal gasification area disrupted manufacturing 
operations. There were no serious injuries and no impact to the 
environment. All manufacturing operations have resumed except for coal 
gasification. Due to the unique advantages of our scale and integration, 
the company has made excellent progress in repairing the facility and 
implemented alternate processes to maintain operations of downstream 
derivative facilities of coal gasification. We expect the coal 
gasification area to be operable by the end of fourth quarter 2017. This, 
along with our mitigating actions, is expected to enable full production 
of acetyl chemicals and derivatives. Normal operations are expected to 
resume in early 2018. 
 
   While the company continues to assess the financial impact of the 
incident, the net impact is expected to reduce operating earnings by 
between $50 and $100 million. Costs in fourth quarter 2017 related to 
the incident are expected to be approximately $100 million, partially 
offset by insurance recovery expected in first half 2018. 
 
   Outlook 
 
 
 
   Commenting on the outlook for full-year 2017, Costa said: ""Our excellent 
third-quarter results build on the strong performance we have delivered 
throughout the year.  We continue to create our own growth with 
innovative, high margin products in what remains an uncertain global 
business environment. Capital allocation and cost management are also 
contributing to earnings growth. As a result, our expectations for 
adjusted 2017 EPS growth have improved to be solidly at the high end of 
the previously projected range of 10 to 12 percent compared with 2016, 
excluding the financial impact of the Kingsport operational incident."" 
 
   The full-year 2017 projected earnings exclude any non-core, unusual, or 
non-recurring items in fourth quarter 2017, assumes that the adjusted 
tax rate detailed in Tables 4A and 4B for first nine months 2017 will be 
the actual rate for full-year 2017, and excludes the financial impact of 
the Kingsport operational incident. Our 2017 financial results forecasts 
do not include non-core items (such as mark-to-market pension and other 
postretirement benefit gain or loss) or any unusual or non-recurring 
items, and we accordingly are unable to reconcile projected full-year 
2017 earnings excluding non-core and any unusual or non-recurring items 
to reported GAAP earnings without unreasonable efforts. 
 
   Forward-Looking Statements 
 
   This news release includes forward-looking statements concerning current 
expectations and assumptions for future global economic conditions; 
competitive position and acceptance of specialty products in key 
markets; mix of products sold; raw material and energy prices and costs, 
and other costs; and revenue, earnings, and cash flow for full-year 
2017. Such expectations and assumptions are based upon certain 
preliminary information, internal estimates, and management assumptions, 
expectations, and plans, and are subject to a number of risks and 
uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions, events, and 
results. Actual results could differ materially from expectations and 
assumptions expressed in the forward-looking statements if one or more 
of the underlying assumptions or expectations prove to be inaccurate or 
are unrealized. Important factors that could cause actual results to 
differ materially from such expectations are and will be detailed in the 
company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission , including 
the Form 10-Q filed for second quarter 2017 available, and the Form 10-Q

Mohawk Industries Reports Q3 Results

Canada NewsWire

CALHOUN, Ga., Oct. 26, 2017

CALHOUN, Ga., Oct. 26, 2017 /CNW/ -- Mohawk Industries, Inc . (NYSE: MHK) today announced 2017 third quarter, net earnings of $270 million and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.61. Adjusted net earnings were $281 million and EPS was $3.75, excluding restructuring, acquisition and other charges, a 7% increase over last year. Net sales for the third quarter of 2017 were $2.4 billion, up 7% in the quarter and 5% on a constant days and currency basis. For the third quarter of 2016, net sales were $2.3 billion, net earnings were $270 million and EPS was $3.62; adjusted net earnings were $261 million and EPS was $3.50, excluding restructuring, acquisition and other charges.

For the nine months ending September 30, 2017, net earnings and EPS were $731 million and $9.77, respectively. Adjusted net earnings and EPS were $763 million and $10.19, excluding restructuring, acquisition and other charges, a 9% increase over last year. For the nine-month period, net sales were $7.1 billion, an increase of 5% and 5.5% on a constant days and currency basis. For the nine-month period ending October 1, 2016, net sales were $6.8 billion, net earnings were $697 million and EPS was $9.34; adjusted net earnings and EPS were $697 million and $9.35, excluding restructuring, acquisition and other charges.

Commenting on Mohawk Industries ' third quarter performance, Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum , Chairman and CEO, stated, ""During the period, Mohawk delivered record adjusted earnings and EPS, with sales growing approximately 7%. Our businesses outside the U.S. had stronger revenue growth, as the economies of those countries expanded. In the period, we overcame rising material costs, disruptions from hurricanes and reduced patent revenue. Our price and mix improved as we enhanced our product offering and implemented pricing actions to recover inflation. Our many operational and process improvements resulted in productivity gains of approximately $49 million and we incurred $8 million of start-up costs.

""For the full year, we are investing about $900 million to optimize long-term results by entering new product categories, extending our reach into new geographies and facilitating growth in our existing businesses. These projects include ceramic expansions in Mexico, Russia, Italy and Poland; additional premium laminate, engineered wood, rug and polyester carpet capacity in the U.S.; and increased premium laminate capacity in Europe and Russia. These investments will satisfy increasing demand for our products as well as introduce state-of-the-art manufacturing technology to further our position as the industry's innovation leader. During 2018, in the U.S., we will launch production of rigid LVT as well as quartz countertops. In Europe, we will enter the rigid LVT, carpet tile and porcelain countertop businesses, and in Russia we will open a manufacturing plant to participate in the country's large sheet vinyl market.

""For the quarter, our Flooring Rest of the World Segment's sales increased 13% as reported and 8% on a constant days and currency basis. The segment had an exceptional quarter with the majority of our manufactured product sales and earnings growing dramatically. Our patent revenue is running at a higher rate than we anticipated due to broader use of our patents and the increase in worldwide sales of LVT. During the period, our price and mix improvements offset inflation and currency changes. Our laminate innovation in proprietary structures and water-proof technologies is increasing the selection of our products by customers who would ordinarily purchase wood flooring. Our present European LVT manufacturing is nearing capacity, and our new plant will begin operating by the end of the year. The new plant will expand our capacity of flexible LVT as well as produce rigid LVT. We are expanding the segment's commercial sales force to increase the specifications of sheet vinyl, LVT and our upcoming carpet tile collections. Our new commercial carpet tile plant should initiate limited production in the fourth quarter.

""For the quarter, our Global Ceramic Segment sales increased 9% as reported and 7% on a constant days and currency basis. In the quarter, the strongest growth in our ceramic business was in Russia and Mexico as well as our acquisitions in Italy and Poland, which have been integrated with our existing European ceramic business. New capacity came online during the period with new production in Mexico and our modernized commercial tile plant in Italy. We also started up idled assets at our Polish plant, and we are installing additional equipment to broaden our position in the Northern and Central European markets. Our U.S. ceramic business was softer than we anticipated due to the impact of hurricanes in two of the country's largest ceramic markets. In the third and fourth quarters of this year, we are opening about 15 service centers and stone centers in key U.S. markets. Our North American manufacturing plants are operating at record levels for volume, quality and cost. Our sales and margins in Mexico increased as we broadened our product offering and enlarged our customer base. During the period, our European ceramic business increased dramatically, with growth in our local markets and the addition of our Italian and Polish acquisitions. Our Russian ceramic business is meaningfully outperforming the industry, and we are adding capacity to increase our share as the market expands.

""During the quarter, our Flooring North America Segment's sales increased 2% as reported. The segment's price, mix and productivity improved significantly during the period, covering increases in raw materials and other inflation. Our new product introductions improved our average selling prices and margins, and our process innovations and investments in manufacturing technology improved our costs. The hurricanes in Texas and Florida interrupted normal purchasing patterns and impacted our sales during the period. For the quarter, our soft surfaces sales growth exceeded hard surfaces, which were constrained by production limitations that will be addressed in the fourth quarter. Growth in our residential carpet outpaced our commercial sales. We have recently announced a 5 to 6% price increase on all of our carpet products effective the end of this year to cover our increasing costs. We have enhanced the productivity of our U.S. LVT operations, and we are expanding our product offering in both the residential and commercial categories. We have introduced a proprietary rigid LVT collection designed for exceptional stability and durability as we prepare for our new U.S. LVT production in the second quarter of next year. Our new laminate production will be operational this quarter and will allow us to expand our successful water proof laminate that improves on Mother Nature in both performance and visuals.

""In the fourth quarter, we anticipate that the business will improve as we benefit from innovative new products, increased volume and the performance of our recent acquisitions. We expect higher sales with the relief of some of our capacity constraints, enabling us to expand our market position. During the upcoming period, we will absorb higher start-up costs estimated at $15 million in our results as new operations come online. The disruptions caused by hurricanes in the U.S. should diminish as those markets begin their recovery. Greater productivity, better product mix and price changes should improve our fourth quarter results, overcoming the reductions from our expired patents. Taking all of this into account, our EPS guidance for the fourth quarter is $3.25 to $3.34, excluding any one-time charges.""

The Company supplements its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with US GAAP, with certain non-GAAP financial measures. As required by the Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the tables above present a reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable US GAAP measure. Each of the non-GAAP measures set forth above should be considered in addition to the comparable US GAAP measure, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures, when reconciled to the corresponding US GAAP measure, help its investors as follows: Non-GAAP revenue measures that assist in identifying growth trends and in comparisons of revenue with prior and future periods and non-GAAP profitability measures that assist in understanding the long-term profitability trends of the Company's business and in comparisons of its profits with prior and future periods.

Press Release: Mohawk Industries Reports Q3 -4-

The Company excludes certain items from its non-GAAP revenue measures because these items can vary dramatically between periods and can obscure underlying business trends. Items excluded from the Company's non-GAAP revenue measures include: foreign currency transactions and translation, more or fewer shipping days in a period and the impact of acquisitions.

The Company excludes certain items from its non-GAAP profitability measures because these items may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the Company's core operating performance. Items excluded from the Company's non-GAAP profitability measures include: restructuring, acquisition and integration-related and other costs, legal settlements and reserves, tradename impairments, acquisition purchase accounting, including inventory step-up, release of indemnification assets and the reversal of uncertain tax positions.

Press Release: Fitch Affirms Duke Energy  at 'BBB+'; Outlook Negative


 
 
The following is a press release from Fitch Ratings : 
 ","Fitch Ratings-New York-26 October 2017: Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'BBB+' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of Duke Energy Corporation . The Rating Outlook remains Negative.

Duke's Negative Outlook reflects the high consolidated and parent leverage that was exacerbated by the company's predominantly debt-financed $5 billion acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas, Inc . in October 2016. Fitch remains uncertain about Duke's ability to lower leverage to levels acceptable for the current rating. Duke meaningfully improved its business risk profile in 2016 with the Piedmont acquisition and the sale of its unregulated Latin American power assets and used the sale proceeds to pay down some parent level debt. However, Duke's long-term parent level debt is expected to rise in 2017, and Fitch expects it to increase in each of the following two years.

Fitch will continue to monitor Duke's parent level debt, consolidated leverage metrics, and its willingness to issue equity to support credit quality. Pending rate cases at Duke's utility subsidiaries and Duke's ability to recover coal ash costs will also play a factor in Duke's ratings.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

High Consolidated and Parent Leverage: Fitch projects Duke's total adjusted debt/EBITDAR and FFO adjusted leverage to peak at 5.4x and 5.7x, respectively, in 2017. In order to maintain its 'BBB+' Long-Term IDR, Duke would need to demonstrate the ability to reduce these leverage metrics to 4.8x and 5.1x, respectively, by 2019. The percentage of holding company debt (including intermediate holdco Progress Energy, Inc .) is also high. Fitch expects holdco debt to peak at about 35% in 2017 and not fall below 31%-32% during the intermediate term.

Pending Rate Cases: Duke's utility subsidiaries have several pending rate cases, which will play a factor in determining the strength of Duke's financial profile in the near term. Duke Energy Progress, LLC (DEP) filed in June 2017 with the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) for a $477.5 million, or 14.9%, electric rate increase. Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (DEC) filed in August 2017 with the NCUC for a $611 million, or 12.8%, electric rate increase and is also seeking an additional $36 million revenue requirement increase through a proposed grid reliability and resiliency rider. These rate cases include requests to recover already incurred expenses related to coal ash remediation. The NCUC is expected to decide on the DEP rate case by Jan. 31, 2018 and the DEC rate case by the end of April 2018.

Coal Ash Remediation: Coal ash remediation will require substantial capital investment over the long-term. As of Dec. 31, 2016, Duke had an asset retirement obligation of $5.15 billion, most of which is in North Carolina at its DEC and DEP utilities. Although Fitch expects the coal ash costs to be recoverable in rates similar to other environmental capex, delays to timely cost recovery could pressure credit metrics.

High Quality Core Businesses: Duke's solid business risk profile reflects the company's ownership of primarily low-risk, regulated businesses. The company benefits from a significant amount of regulatory and geographic diversity and relatively predictable earnings and cash flow. Each of Duke's regulated electric and natural gas utilities has a solid credit profile. Investments in relatively low-risk contracted renewables and FERC-regulated electric and gas transmission projects round out the portfolio.

Constructive Regulation: Duke's utility subsidiaries operate in seven states, each of which Fitch considers to have a constructive regulatory environment. Credit quality is supported by timely recovery of costs and reasonable rates of return.

Aggressive Growth Plan: Consolidated capex is forecast to average nearly $10 billion annually through 2021, well in excess of the $7 billion average spending over 2014-2016. Regulated utility investments account for approximately 90% of the capex plan. The plan also includes investments in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, other pipeline investments and renewable generation. A significant amount of growth capex is recoverable through rider mechanisms or power purchase agreements.

DERIVATION SUMMARY

Duke Energy Corporation 's 'BBB+' Long-Term IDR is weakly-positioned relative to some of its peer parent holding companies due to the company's large amount of parent-level debt and relatively high consolidated leverage metrics. The holding company debt as a proportion of total consolidated debt at Duke is approximately 35%, which is high, compared, for example, with the 25% holding company debt figure at The Southern Company (A-/Rating Watch Negative). Duke's projected leverage metrics for 2017-2020 are weak for the rating, with projected total adjusted debt/EBITDAR in the range of 4.9x-5.4x and FFO adjusted leverage of 5.0x-5.7x. Southern Company 's projected leverage metrics of 4.7x-5.0x and 4.8x-5.1x, respectively, are slightly better than Duke's, while American Electric Power Company, Inc .'s (AEP; BBB+/Stable) projected leverage metrics of 4.1x-4.3x and 4.1x-4.3x, respectively, are significantly stronger. Duke's geographic and regulatory diversity and business mix is similar to that of Southern Company .

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Duke include:

--$49 billion five-year capex plan;

--Ash pond remediation costs are recoverable from ratepayers;Ã

--Current rider mechanisms remain in effect;

--Balanced rate case decisions consistent with prior outcomes;

--Normal weather.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action

--A positive rating action is not likely given the high level of parent debt and expected increase in consolidated leverage. Ratings could be affirmed with a Stable Outlook if Fitch were to expect adjusted total debt/EBITDAR to improve to 4.8x and FFO adjusted leverage to improve to 5.1x by 2019. Factors that could support favorable resolution of the Negative Outlook include management's willingness to reduce parent-level debt through equity issuances or other means, constructive rate case decisions in North Carolina, and clarity regarding Duke's ability to recover coal ash costs.

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action

--Ratings could be downgraded if Fitch were to expect adjusted total debt/EBITDAR and FFO adjusted leverage to exceed 4.8x and 5.1x, respectively, on a sustainable basis after 2019. Factors playing into a rating downgrade include continued high leverage, a deterioration of the regulatory environment in North Carolina, and an inability to recover coal ash costs.

LIQUIDITY

Fitch considers Duke's liquidity to be adequate. Duke and its utility subsidiaries primarily meet their short-term liquidity needs through a $4.85 billion commercial paper (CP) program that is supported by an $8 billion committed master credit facility (MCF). The MCF is used to issue CP, letters of credit and variable-rate demand tax-exempt bonds. The facility includes borrowing sub-limits for Duke and its subsidiaries, each of which is party to the MCF. Duke has the unilateral ability to at any time increase or decrease the borrowing sub-limits for each borrower, within specified limits. The termination date of the MCF is March 16, 2022.

At June 30, 2017, Duke had $3,115 million of CP outstanding, $68 million of outstanding letters of credit and $81 million of tax-exempt bonds issued under the MCF. In addition, $500 million of available capacity is set aside to meet obligations related to violations at North Carolina facilities with ash basins. Unencumbered available capacity was $4,236 million at June 30, 2017.

Duke and its subsidiaries participate in a corporate money pool that supports short-term borrowing needs. Duke may lend funds to the pool, but may not borrow from the pool. Duke's CP program and excess utility cash are the primary source of funds for the money pool.

The holding company also has a $1 billion revolving credit facility that matures June 2020. As of June 30, 2017, $270 million was drawn under the three-year revolver.

Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

The information in this report is provided Ã¢ oeas isÃ¢ without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.

For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001

""We delivered another excellent quarter of operating performance,"" said J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr ., Chairman, President and CEO. ""We posted strong revenue growth, expanded margins, completed 6 brokerage tuck-in mergers and grew earnings per share in the quarter. During this same period, many of our clients faced challenges related to unprecedented natural disasters. I'm proud of how quickly our employees anticipated and addressed clients' needs even as many dealt with their own losses. In addition, consistent with the values of our unique Gallagher culture, others generously volunteered and contributed to relief efforts.""

""Over the past month, I met with almost all of our global leaders and many insurance carriers. My discussions, and our own internal data, continue to suggest a stable global P&C rate environment. Of particular note, Australia and New Zealand are continuing to see rate increases, and it appears there could be some modest hardening on U.S. property lines. Regardless of industry conditions, our talented team will help our clients navigate the current insurance market place, and I believe we are well positioned for a strong finish to 2017, and for another excellent year in 2018.""

   audit timing noted above, the reported and adjusted third quarter operating 
   ratios were 2.0 pts and 2.1 pts higher than the same period in 2016, 
   respectively. Both ratios were impacted by increased business insurance, 
   bad debts and ramp-up costs associated with new business wins in Australia, 
   all totaling approximately $3.0 million.

Press Release: Arthur J. Gallagher & Co . -4-

Corporate Segment Reported GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Reconciliations (continued):

Interest and banking costs and debt - At September 30, 2017, Gallagher had $2,798.0 million of borrowings from private placements, $75.0 million of short-term borrowings under its line of credit facility and $156.4 million outstanding under a revolving loan facility that provides funding for premium finance receivables, which are fully collateralized by the underlying premiums held by insurance carriers, and as such are excluded from our debt covenant computations. Gallagher issued $398.0 million private placement debt in early August 2017 to fund the repayment of debt that matured on August 3, 2017 and reduced the credit facility balance.

Clean energy - Consists of the operating results related to our investments in 34 clean coal production plants and royalty income from clean coal licenses related to Chem-Mod LLC . Additional information regarding these results is available in the ""CFO Commentary"" at ajg.com/IR.

Acquisition costs - Consists mostly of external professional fees and other due diligence costs related to acquisitions.

Corporate - Consists of overhead allocations mostly related to corporate staff compensation and other corporate level activities. In the CFO commentary document as of September 15, 2017, we provided an estimate of our third quarter 2017 after-tax loss for this line ranging between $5.0 million and $6.0 million. As shown on the previous page, we actually reported a loss of $8.7 million. Most of the variance was due to unrealized losses on the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates on the remeasurement of monetary assets, net of liabilities, denominated in non-functional currencies on the balance sheets of our non-U.S. operations. As of October 25, 2017, most of that unrealized loss has reversed as the dollar has strengthened subsequent to September 30, 2017.

Litigation Settlement - During the third quarter of 2015, Gallagher settled litigation against certain former U.K. executives and their advisors for a pretax gain of $31.0 million ($22.3 million net of costs and taxes). Incremental expenses that arose in connection with this matter resulted in quarterly after-tax charges being incurred through June 30, 2017. No such charges were incurred in this segment in the third quarter of 2017.

Home Office Lease Termination/Move - During first quarter 2017, we relocated our corporate office headquarters to a nearby suburb of Chicago. Move-related after-tax charges, including after-tax lease abandonment charges, were $3.7 million in the third quarter of 2017. Move-related after-tax charges are expected to total approximately $0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Income Taxes

Gallagher allocates the provision for income taxes to its Brokerage and Risk Management segments using the local country statutory rates. Gallagher's consolidated effective tax rate for the quarters ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 was (42.5)% and (37.4)%, respectively, which was lower than the statutory rate due to the amount of IRC Section 45 tax credits earned and the impact of the income tax benefit of stock compensation in third quarter 2017.

Webcast Conference Call

Gallagher will host a webcast conference call on Thursday, October 26, 2017 at 5:15 p.m. ET/4:15 p.m. CT. To listen to this call, please go to ajg.com/IR. The call will be available for replay at such website for at least 90 days.

Gallagher's actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Readers are therefore cautioned against relying on any of the forward-looking statements, which are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following: 


   -- Risks and uncertainties related to Gallagher's clean energy investments, 
      including uncertainties related to political and regulatory risks, such 
      as potential actions by Congress or challenges by the IRS  eliminating or 
      reducing the availability of tax credits under IRC Section 45 
      retroactively and/or going forward; the ability to maintain and find 
      co-investors; the potential for divergent business objectives by 
      co-investors and other stakeholders; plant operational risks, including 
      supply-chain risks; utilities' future use of, or demand for, coal; the 
      market price of coal; the costs of moving a clean coal plant; 
      intellectual property litigation risks; and environmental risks - all of 
      which could impact (i) and (ii) above; and 
 
   -- Changes in worldwide and national economic conditions; changes in premium 
      rates and in insurance markets generally; changes in the insurance 
      brokerage industry's competitive landscape; changes in accounting 
      standards; and the uncertainties and challenges inherent in the 
      acquisition integration process - all of which could impact (iii) - (vi) 
      above. 

Please refer to Gallagher's filings with the SEC, including Item 1A, ""Risk Factors,"" of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 for a more detailed discussion of these and other factors that could impact its forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement made by Gallagher in this press release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by applicable law, Gallagher does not undertake to update the information included herein or the corresponding earnings release posted on Gallagher's website.

Information Regarding Non-GAAP Measures

In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, this press release provides information regarding EBITDAC, EBITDAC margin, adjusted EBITDAC, adjusted EBITDAC margin, diluted net earnings per share, as adjusted (adjusted EPS), for the Brokerage and Risk Management segments, adjusted revenues, adjusted compensation and operating expenses, adjusted compensation expense ratio, adjusted operating expense ratio and organic revenue measures for each operating segment. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, the GAAP information provided in this press release. Gallagher's management believes that these presentations provide useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Gallagher's results of operations and financial condition. See further below for definitions and the reason each of these measures is useful to investors. Gallagher's industry peers may provide similar supplemental non-GAAP information with respect to one or more of these measures, although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments. The non-GAAP information provided by Gallagher should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the GAAP information provided. As disclosed in its most recent Proxy Statement, beginning in first quarter 2017, Gallagher makes determinations regarding certain elements of executive officer compensation, performance share awards and annual cash incentive awards, partly on the basis of measures related to adjusted EBITDAC. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year amounts reported in this press release in order to conform them to the current year presentation.

Adjusted Non-GAAP presentation - Gallagher believes that the adjusted non-GAAP presentations of the current and prior year information, presented in this earnings release, provide stockholders and other interested persons with useful information regarding certain financial metrics of Gallagher that may assist such persons in analyzing Gallagher's operating results as they develop a future earnings outlook for Gallagher. The after-tax amounts related to the adjustments were computed using the normalized effective tax rate for each respective period. See pages 13 and 14 for a reconciliation of the adjustments made to income taxes. 


   -- Adjusted revenues and expenses - Revenues, compensation expense and 
      operating expense, respectively, each adjusted to exclude the following: 
 
   -- Net gains realized from sales of books of business, which are primarily 
      net proceeds received related to sales of books of business and other 
      divestiture transactions. 
 
   -- Acquisition integration costs, which include costs related to certain of 
      our large acquisitions, outside the scope of our usual tuck-in strategy, 
      not expected to occur on an ongoing basis in the future once we fully 
      assimilate the applicable acquisition.  These costs are typically 
      associated with redundant workforce, extra lease space, duplicate

Press Release: Arthur J. Gallagher & Co . -5-


      services and external costs incurred to assimilate the acquisition with 
      our IT related systems. 
 
   -- Workforce related charges, which primarily include severance costs 
      related to employee terminations and other costs associated with 
      redundant workforce. 
 
   -- Lease termination related charges, which primarily include costs related 
      to terminations of real estate leases and abandonment of leased space. 
 
   -- Acquisition related adjustments, which include change in estimated 
      acquisition earnout payables adjustments, impacts of acquisition 
      valuation true-ups, impairment charges and acquisition related 
      compensation charges. 

(9 of 14) 


   -- The impact of foreign currency translation, as applicable.  The amounts 
      excluded with respect to foreign currency translation are calculated by 
      applying current year foreign exchange rates to the same periods in the 
      prior year. 
 
   -- Adjusted ratios - Adjusted compensation expense and adjusted operating 
      expense, respectively, each divided by adjusted revenues. 

Non-GAAP Earnings Measures 


   -- EBITDAC and EBITDAC margin - EBITDAC is net earnings before interest, 
      income taxes, depreciation, amortization and the change in estimated 
      acquisition earnout payables and EBITDAC margin is EBITDAC divided by 
      total revenues.  These measures for the Brokerage and Risk Management 
      segments provide a meaningful representation of Gallagher's operating 
      performance and, for the overall business, provide a meaningful way to 
      measure its financial performance on an ongoing basis. 
 
   -- Adjusted EBITDAC and Adjusted EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted EBITDAC is 
      EBITDAC adjusted to exclude net gains realized from sales of books of 
      business, acquisition integration costs, workforce related charges, lease 
      termination related charges, acquisition related adjustments and the 
      period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation, as applicable 
      and Adjusted EBITDAC margin is Adjusted EBITDAC divided by total adjusted 
      revenues (defined above).  These measures for the Brokerage and Risk 
      Management segments provide a meaningful representation of Gallagher's 
      operating performance, and are also presented to improve the 
      comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of 
      the items that have a high degree of variability. 
 
   -- Adjusted EPS for the Brokerage and Risk Management segments - Net 
      earnings adjusted to exclude the after-tax impact of net gains realized 
      from sales of books of business, acquisition integration costs, the 
      impact of foreign currency translation, workforce related charges, lease 
      termination related charges and acquisition related adjustments divided 
      by diluted weighted average shares outstanding.  This measure provides a 
      meaningful representation of Gallagher's operating performance (and as 
      such should not be used as a measure of Gallagher's liquidity), and is 
      also presented to improve the comparability of our results between 
      periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of 
      variability. 

Organic Revenues (a non-GAAP measure) - For the Brokerage segment, organic change in base commission and fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions and the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented. These commissions and fees are excluded from organic revenues in order to help interested persons analyze the revenue growth associated with the operations that were a part of Gallagher in both the current and prior year. In addition, change in base commission and fee revenue organic growth excludes the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation. For the Risk Management segment, organic change in fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of fee revenues generated from acquisitions and the fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented. In addition, change in organic growth excludes the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability or are due to the limited-time nature of these revenue sources.

These revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable, but non-GAAP, measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that are expected to continue in the current year and beyond. Gallagher has historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of its Brokerage and Risk Management segments. Gallagher also believes that using this non-GAAP measure allows readers of our financial statements to measure, analyze and compare the growth from its Brokerage and Risk Management segments in a meaningful and consistent manner.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Information Presented to GAAP Measures - This press release includes tabular reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures, as follows: for EBITDAC (on pages 11 and 12), for adjusted revenues, adjusted EBITDAC and adjusted diluted net earnings per share (on pages 2 and 3), for organic revenue measures (on pages 4 and 6, respectively, for the Brokerage and Risk Management segments), for adjusted compensation and operating expenses and adjusted EBITDAC margin (on pages 5, 6, and 7, respectively, for the Brokerage and Risk Management segments). Reported compensation and operating expense ratios can also be found in the ""Supplemental Quarterly Data"" available at ajg.com/IR.

Thermo Fisher Scientific Signs Oncology Companion Diagnostic Development 
Agreement with Blueprint Medicines 
 
 
   Agreement to expand Oncomine Dx Target Test with RET fusion markers to 
treat non-small cell lung cancer patients 
 
 
   PR Newswire 
 
 
   CARLSBAD, Calif., Oct. 31, 2017 
 
 
   CARLSBAD, Calif., Oct. 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- As part of its ongoing 
commitment to increase the utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
in the clinic, Thermo Fisher Scientific  announced today it has expanded 
the development of its Oncomine Dx Target Test by entering into an 
agreement with Blueprint Medicines Corporation  to develop and 
commercialize the Oncomine Dx Target Test as a companion diagnostic 
(CDx) for BLU-667 to identify RET fusions in people with non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC). 
 
 
   Taken orally, BLU-667 is a potent and selective inhibitor of the kinase 
RET, including RET fusions and mutations, currently being evaluated by 
Blueprint Medicines in a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of 
patients with RET-driven NSCLC, thyroid cancer and other advanced solid 
tumors (NCT03037385). The CDx will complement efforts to drive 
enrollment to the trial. Once validation is complete, Thermo Fisher  will 
submit a supplemental premarket approval application to the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA)  to expand the clinical claims for its 
Oncomine Dx Target Test. 
 
 
   Under the terms of the agreement, Thermo Fisher  will also retain the 
rights to commercialize the test globally and will lead all necessary 
filings to seek clearance from regional regulatory agencies for the 
test. Expansion of the CDx is part of a strategic plan to develop one 
test for multiple therapies. Use of an approved multi-gene CDx to 
simultaneously screen patients for targeted therapies is a shift away 
from the conventional testing method of running several, 
single-biomarker analyses in sequence to identify tumor profiles. 
 
 
   Studies have shown that RET fusions and mutations are present in 
multiple cancers. In NSCLC, which accounts for 85 percent of all lung 
cancers in the United States,(1) RET fusions are believed to be key 
disease drivers in about 1-2 percent of patients. There are more than 
220,000 new cases of lung cancer each year in the U.S., and the disease 
leads to more deaths than colon, breast and prostate cancer combined, 
according to the American Cancer Society . 
 
 
   The agreement with Blueprint Medicines marks the second CDx development 
program Thermo Fisher  has signed this year to expand the Oncomine Dx 
Target Test, which received FDA  approval in June and its first positive 
coverage decision by Regence Blue Cross Blue Shield this month. In May, 
the company announced a similar agreement with Agios Pharmaceuticals  to 
expand the test's indication to include IDH1 mutations in 
cholangiocarcinoma, a rare form of cancer that affects the human bile 
duct system with a high unmet medical need. 
 
 
   ""We are pleased to work with Blueprint Medicines and leverage the 
expandability of the FDA-approved Oncomine Dx Target Test to offer it as 
a companion diagnostic for BLU-667,"" said Joydeep Goswami, president of 
Clinical Next-Generation Sequencing and Oncology at Thermo Fisher 
Scientific . ""It also helps us accelerate delivery on our commitment to 
bring NGS to mainstream clinical practice so that patients can start 
benefiting from targeted therapies more quickly.""

1338 ET - Blue Apron falls below $5 for the first time, down more than 50% since going public this summer for $10. The New York City-based company is down 3% to $4.86 ahead of 3Q earnings, which are expected before the market opens Thursday. HelloFresh , a Berlin-based meal-kit company that is one of Blue Apron's leading competitors, is set to go public on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange the same day. Its target valuation of around $1.7B compares to Blue Apron's current market capitalization of $928M. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)","1323 ET - HCA Healthcare CEO R Milton Johnson tells analysts ""nothing could have prepared us"" for the ""unprecedented"" string of disasters that struck Texas, Florida and Nevada in 3Q. Hurricanes struck Texas in Corpus Christi and Houston, where HCA operates 16 hospitals, and Florida, one of the company's largest markets with 50 hospitals. Storm-related expenses and revenue losses lowered the company's 3Q earnings per share by 24 cents, HCA said. Performance so far this quarter in Houston and Miami point to recovery from the storms, Samuel Hazen , HCA's COO told analysts. ""The indications, coming out of the gate in the fourth quarter, given the significance of the events in those markets, does not suggest any permanent issues that would be a result of the hurricanes."" Shares slip 1.4%. (melanie.evans@wsj.com)

1322 ET - Kellogg is transitioning away from delivering its snacks directly to stores, and is sending them to retailers' warehouses instead. That hurts sales, as Kellogg doesn't have representatives in stores to promote its brands, and it's doing fewer displays and removing some low-selling products from shelves. But, outgoing Chief John Bryant says the transition reduces Kellogg's overhead costs by cutting its workforce and eliminating warehouse leases. It also has pleased retailers, he says, because now Kellogg's snacks go through their warehouses, making things more efficient, transferring work to the retailers, and giving retailers a higher profit margin.

1310 ET - Leaders in the aerospace and defense sector still oppose the nomination of former Rep. Scott Garrett to head the US Export-Import Bank , even after testimony released Tuesday included a pledge from him to support its future operations. The Aerospace Industries Association has campaigned against the nomination of Garrett, who's twice voted to shut down the bank, a big backer of overseas sales for companies ranging from Boeing and General Electric to SpaceX . ""Nothing has changed regarding our attitude towards him,"" a spokesman for the aerospace industry's main trade group says. (doug.cameron@wsj.com; @dougcameron)

1309 ET - The FTSE 100 index closes up 0.7% at 7493.08, tracking gains in European stocks as political tension between Spain and Catalonia eases, helped by a 1.71% gain in heavyweight oil company BP PLC after strong 3Q results. Positive sentiment offsets the impact of a stronger pound before an expected Bank of England rate rise Thursday. However, the FTSE 100 closes below the 7500 level and underperforms European stocks, with the STOXX Europe 600 index up 0.33%. Croda International jumps 4.24% after backing full-year guidance. easyJet gains 3.16% after strong Ryanair earnings. Miners fall, however, with Fresnillo down 2.6% and Glencore down 2.23%.

1305 ET - US oil production fells to 9.20M bpd in August from 9.23M in July, the EIA says. The monthly August number is in line with EIA projections for production to have averaged 9.22M bpd in 3Q, and it's 6% higher than August 2016 output of 8.7M. But the month-on-month decline raises further doubts as to whether output will surge in 4Q to average 9.6M bpd, as the EIA is forecasting. US oil production has been kept in check lately by low oil prices near $50 as producers hold off on bringing wells to the production stage. Rising costs of oilfield services relative to oil prices has also played a key role. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

1300 ET - Nordic markets close mixed with Sweden's OMXS30 index ending the day 0.6% higher, the pan-Nordic OMXN40 index up 0.1% while Oslo's oil-heavy OBX index slid 0.4%. Trading was rather muted on the final trading day of the month, as markets took a breather ahead of some key events later this week, including earnings from Apple and Facebook , the U.S. monthly jobs report and updates from the Federal Reserve and Bank of England . In oil, a bull/bear fight at $61 on Brent crude has extended into a second day, Saxo Bank said. ""This...has become a line in the sand and the result of this battle is likely to determine the short-term direction of oil."" (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)

1300 ET - Qualcomm falls after WSJ reported Monday reported that Apple, which uses Qualcomm communications chips in a portion of recent iPhones, is working to find alternatives with an eye toward eliminating Qualcomm components from its next-generation devices. That puts at risk the $2.1B, or 13% of Qualcomm 's total chip revenue, that Apple is likely to spend on its chips this year, according to an estimate by Macquarie Capital. The two companies are embroiled in a bitter dispute over patent royalties Qualcomm charges for use of its patents, which handset makers pay whether or not they use Qualcomm 's silicon. Apple alleges that Qualcomm uses its dominant position in chips to charge exorbitant royalties. Qualcomm asserts that its technology has enabled Apple and others to build lucrative businesses and that licensees enter into their agreements voluntarily. QCOM stumbles 7.4% to $50.60.

1253 ET - As buyout speculation lifted Dunkin Brands 8% Monday, analysts began asking: Why now? The purported buyer, JAB Holdings , which also owns Peet's Coffee, Krispy Kreme and Panera, among others, has already absorbed about $700M in debt from its recent acquisitions. If the privately held group were to buy Dunkin, it would include $3B of debt--four times the amount of all of its recent coffee deals combined, Mizuho says. William Blair points out that rumors involving a JAB/Dunkin deal have been circulating for two years, at times when Dunkin stock was much less expensive than it is today. And if JAB were to gobble up Dunkin, what would it do with the Baskin-Robbins ice-cream business, which doesn't seem to fit with JAB's portfolio of breakfast-related companies? ""While we would never say never, we do not see any new revelations in Dunkin's business model to date that would render JAB more interested today than at any other point over the past few years,"" William Blair argues. (julie.jargon@wsj.com)

1246 ET - While Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the election moved into a higher gear this week, investors mostly shrugged off the developments. Investors say their trades over the last two days have been largely based on companies' 3Q profit reports, with some weak results crimping markets on Monday and a stronger batch sending indexes higher Tuesday. ""Whether it's charges filled by Mueller or the next tweet sent out [by President Trump], I don't think it's going to affect markets,"" says Jon Mackay, investment strategist of Schroders . Paul Karrlsson-Willis , head of global equity sales and trading at Cabrera Capital , adds that investors who reacted to headlines have been burned before, as they watched stocks like Amazon subsequently rise higher. ""People are nervous about where the market is today, but they can't get out because they'll worry about underperforming,"" Karrlsson-Willis says. Some money managers say the big political news this week for markets is the naming of the next Fed chairman. (michael.wursthorn@wsj.com; @4BetterOrWurst)

1232 ET - For years, breakfast-cereal sales have been hurting in the US, and Kellogg has maintained optimism about the business, saying it will return to growth. Despite sales declines persisting in the latest quarter, Kellogg's head of North America Paul Norman says Kellogg is trying to appeal to the healthy-eating trends with brands like Special K, adding cereals with probiotics and other attributes. Meanwhile, it's focused on fun flavors and more convenient ways to eat cereal with some of its kid-centered brands, like its new Cinnamon Frosted Flakes. ""We do need to still bring transformational innovation to cereal and to the breakfast occasion,"" Norman says, adding that people will see more of that in coming months. Kellogg's new CEO Steve Cahillane is also coming in with rose-colored glassed. ""Across the globe, I see more opportunities than I do challenges,"" he says. ""I think the pessimism around this category in US food is overdone."" (annie.gasparro@wsj.com)

1232 ET - Moody's has a generally upbeat view on the UK property market. Colin Ellis, EMEA chief credit officer at Moody's Investors Service, says the credit rating agency hasn't seen a substantial negative impact from Brexit and that there may be ""a little bit of unexpected resilience,"" ahead of us. Still, there is some downside risk, Ellis says. Moody's has maintained its stable outlook for the prime property market, since borrowers in this sub-sector are less affected by the rise in inflation, according to Annabel Schaafsma, senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service.

0630 GMT - Citic Securities ' Jan-Sep earnings achieved 76% of Deutsche Bank 's full-year estimate for the broker, with decent recovery in 3Q mainly driven by net investment gains, which, on the other hand, was a drag on smaller peer Huatai. But Huatai also accomplished 73% of DB's full-year forecast, with growth in investment banking and resilient asset management fees as sweet spots, DB adds. As its 2 sector top picks, DB keeps both stocks rated buy. CITIC Securities inches up 0.1% in late session Tuesday while Huatai skids 0.9%. The benchmark H-Shares index slips 0.2%. (john.wu@wsj.com)","0352 GMT - Bendigo & Adelaide Bank is down 3.9% following a cautious speech to shareholders from the regional lender's managing director. Patersons Securities notes that total balance sheet growth will be relatively flat this half in the wake of macroprudential controls on investor mortgage lending and heightened competition. What was left unsaid by the bank was the profit impact of any slowing in the broader housing market, Patersons adds. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)

0221 GMT - Shares of New China Life Insurance are lower early Tuesday, in the wake of shareholder Swiss Re Direct Investments selling half of its stake on the country's 6th biggest life insurance policy writer, with a 6-month lock-up on the remaining shares. The 6 block trades totaling 75 million shares at HK$47.3 apiece, which was near the low end of an indicative range, translates to a discount of 5.5% to the previous close. Smartkarma analyst Sumeet Singh finds no convincing reason for buying the stock, citing expensive valuations as a major factor. At HK$48.55, NCI is now down 3%, but it's still up a lofty 36% year to date. (john.wu@wsj.com)

0044 GMT - Shares of HSBC will likely stand firm today on the back of a future share buyback guidance. With 71% of an existing $2 billion share purchase plan now completed, the global banking group says it has as much as $10 billion in extra cash to spend on further buybacks under suitable conditions. The stock jumped briefly late in Monday's session following the release of 3Q17 earnings yet closed in negative territory. Deutsche Bank keeps its hold rating on HSBC , saying core earnings in line with expectations and benign capital levels won't change market expectations on buybacks and payouts. (john.wu@wsj.com)

2331 GMT [Dow Jones ] Macquarie gets a number of ticks from Shaw & Partners that support its bullish call on the stock. After a meeting with management, Shaw notes Macquarie's share buyback plan due to increasingly predictable earnings, solid performance fees and pipeline of assets, as well as the prospect of tax cuts in the U.S. that should add more than 5% to earnings. And, it adds, investors can still buy exposure to that at about 13 times forecast earnings. Shares are down 0.2% early, after hitting a record high Monday. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)

2300 GMT - Wholesale funding trends continue to look supportive for Australian bank margins near term, even taking into account the issue of longer-dated debt, Deutsche Bank says. It notes key indicators have been stable to slightly positive for the major banks over the last month, with credit-default swap spreads improving modestly and remaining near the lowest levels in three years. The bank bill overnight index swap spread also improved, while the AUD/USD cross swap spread was unchanged, Deutsche adds. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)

2205 GMT - AT&T and Verizon fell on the news that Sprint was walking away from merger talks with T-Mobile . T was down 1.3% and VZ was down 2.2%. That might seem counterintuitive given that the smaller carriers had said the tie-up would make it easier to take on their larger rivals. But the reality is investors believe the merger would result in less competition. Together, T-Mobile and Sprint would be roughly the same size as AT&T and might not slash prices in order to increase market share. If T-Mobile and Sprint are ever able to reach a deal, antitrust officials at the DOJ might take this signal into consideration. (ryan.knutson@wsj.com ; @ryan_knutson)

2159 GMT - Venture capitalists are betting again on an entrepreneur who helped pioneer a method of treating faulty heart valves without surgery. Georg BÃ¶rtlein co-founded CoreValve, which developed a catheter-based system used to replace aortic valves in the heart. Medtronic acquired CoreValve in 2009 for more than $700M. Venture-capital firm Sofinnova Partners , a CoreValve investor, is leading a EUR12.3M ($14.3M) financing for BÃ¶rtlein's new company, HighLife. HighLife is developing a catheter-based treatment for another heart-valve condition, mitral regurgitation, in which blood leaks back backward through the mitral valve. Physicians already perform catheter-based mitral-valve repair. HighLife is testing a mitral-valve replacement system, betting that valve replacement will prove more effective than repair. (brian.gormley@wsj.com)

2043 GMT - Experts have speculated for months whether President Trump would fire Richard Cordray , Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The president may not have known or cared about Cordray enough to take such a major step. In a surprise revelation, the Obama appointee, says the two ""have never met or spoken."" The statement was part of a letter Cordray sent to Trump Monday, urging him to veto a bill approved by GOP lawmakers last week to overturn his agency's ""arbitration"" rule designed to make it easy for consumers to sue banks in groups. Cordray acknowledged that many thought writing the missive was a waste of time because Trump had already expressed support for the bill. But he tried to give the president a push anyway by appealing to his litigious nature. (yuka.hayashi@wsj.com)

1932 GMT - Canadian medicinal marijuana producer Canopy Growth hit a new year-to-date high following The Wall Street Journal's report that US Corona distributor Constellation Brands took a 9.9% stake in the Canadian firm. The stake, worth about C$245M, will provide Canopy with some marketing and branding heft ahead of the Canadian government 's plans to legalize marijuana next July. The announcement also helped to push much of Canada's listed cannabis-companies higher for the day, while the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF was up about 5%. (david.george-cosh@wsj.com; @itsdgc)

1707 GMT - Pressure on companies that make or distribute opioid painkillers continues to grow from a variety of sources, as seen in a shareholder campaign being waged by state treasurers, asset managers and labor funds with over $1.3T in assets. The coalition says it's filing shareholder proposals at 10 firms in which its members hold shares, including pharmaceutical distributors McKesson and Cardinal Health , and painkiller manufacturers Endo, Insys and JNJ. The proposals ask independent directors to investigate how the companies ""are responding to increasing business risks related to opioids."" The shareholder group is also calling for executive compensation policies that ""deter misconduct."" The coalition includes treasurers from California, Illinois, Connecticut, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, labor funds including the Teamsters and ""faith-based investors"" including hospital operator Trinity Health. (jeanne.whalen@wsj.com)

1648 GMT - Avolon offers a bullish assessment of aircraft demand, with the big leasing company projecting annual passenger traffic growth of 5.4% over the next 20 years, compared with 4.4% and 4.7% in the respective Airbus and Boeing market outlooks. That translates into around 5,000 more jets over 100 seats plus freighters over the period compared to the plane makers' forecasts. Avolon also expects Boeing to claim ""close to"" half of single-aisle deliveries, despite recent sales trends, as well as a larger share of twin-aisle and freighter jets.

--Companies Work with Caltrans, City of Chula Vista and SANDAG to Improve Vehicle Safety, Traffic Efficiency, and Support Path Towards Autonomous Driving--","PR Newswire

SAN DIEGO, Oct. 31, 2017

SAN DIEGO, Oct. 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- AT&T , Ford , Nokia , and Qualcomm Technologies Inc ., a subsidiary of Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM), are helping to accelerate the development of connected cars with the first announced Cellular-V2X (C-V2X) trials in the U.S. Testing is expected to take place in the San Diego Regional Proving Ground with the support of the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), Caltrans, the City of Chula Vista, and intelligent transportation solutions (ITS) provider McCain, Inc . The goal of the trials is to demonstrate the potential of C-V2X technologies, including support for improved automotive safety, automated driving, and traffic efficiency. The trials will also be aimed at demonstrating to automakers and road operators the anticipated cost-efficient benefits associated with embedded cellular technology in vehicles and synergies between the deployment of cellular base stations and roadside infrastructure. The initial testing phase is expected to begin later this year.

Defined by 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) in 2017 as an extension of global cellular standards, C-V2X is an important factor in next-generation wireless technology for safety conscious and automated driving solutions. As wireless technology becomes prevalent, vehicles are using the cellular network for various tasks, ranging from emergency calls and over-the-air (OTA) updates, to diagnostics and real-time traffic updates. Using direct communication mode, C-V2X is designed to help expand the role of wireless technology for road safety applications by facilitating the ability of vehicles to directly communicate with other vehicles, pedestrian devices, and roadside infrastructure, such as traffic signs and construction zones, using the 5.9 GHz band without the involvement of a cellular network, or cellular network subscription. Complementary to other Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) sensors, such as cameras, radar, and LIDAR, C-V2X technology is designed to support 360-degree non-line-of-sight (NLOS) awareness, and is designed to extend a vehicle's ability to see, hear, and understand the environment down the road, at blind intersections, or in bad weather conditions.

For this trial, C-V2X platforms are expected to be installed in Ford vehicles using the Qualcomm(R) 9150 C-V2X solution to facilitate direct communications, and are complemented by AT&T 's 4G LTE network communications and ITS platform that takes advantage of wireless base stations and multi-access edge computing technology from Nokia . For the new communication technologies being deployed, McCain will help facilitate the effective integration with existing and emerging traffic signal control infrastructure.

Testing will support direct C-V2X communications operating in the 5.9 GHz ITS spectrum to explore the safety enhancements of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) use cases, including do not pass warning, intersection movement assist, and left turn assist, to name a few. The trials will also support advanced vehicle communication capabilities for improved traffic efficiencies, such as real-time mapping updates and event notifications relayed using AT&T 's cellular network and Nokia Cloud Infrastructure.

With decades-long experience in automated vehicle testing, advanced features in regional transportation networks, and a global reputation as a high-tech hub for research and wireless innovation, the San Diego region was designated by the U.S. Department of Transportation as one of ten automated vehicle proving grounds in the U.S. earlier this year.

""Leveraging the evolution of embedded cellular technologies for V2X communications holds great potential to advance safety benefits to all road users,"" said Cameron Coursey, vice president, AT&T Internet of Things Solutions. ""Working with industry leaders, such as Ford , Nokia , Qualcomm Technologies , and state and local government agencies, we will together lead the way to safer, more secure, cost-effective, and efficient next-generation solutions.""

""Caltrans has been fully engaged in autonomous and connected vehicle research and testing in recent years,"" said Malcolm Dougherty, director, Caltrans. ""We are proud to join with SANDAG, the City of Chula Vista, public and private sector partners to further the pursuit of innovative technologies on our roadways to improve safety and mobility.""

""The knowledge and partnerships we gain from being a designated proving ground will help us advance innovation, enhance mobility, and improve our transportation systems,"" said Chula Vista Mayor Mary Casillas Salas.

""The advancement of cellular technology for C-V2X applications is very encouraging,"" said Don Butler , executive director, connected vehicle and services, Ford Motor Company . ""This technology promises to meet, and in some cases, exceed the performance requirements of vehicle communication being proposed by relevant government agencies while leveraging existing in-vehicle connectivity frameworks. C-V2X provides a reassuring path to technology advancements necessary to support emerging developments in autonomy, automated driving, and mobility. We are keen to investigate all aspects of this opportunity and support cross industry efforts that make that possible.""

""LTE and 5G technologies have the potential to dramatically transform our lives, and none more so than in transportation,"" said Thorsten Robrecht, head of vertical network slices, Nokia . ""Nokia has a keen interest in creating safe, efficient, and dynamic operating environments for autonomous vehicles, and we have gained much experience from our European projects over the last few years. As such, we are extremely excited to be involved in this project with AT&T , Ford , and Qualcomm Technologies , taking meaningful steps to evaluate what this technology will be able to deliver.""

""Qualcomm Technologies is working towards solutions designed for tomorrow's safer and autonomous vehicles, not only by contributing and evolving C-V2X technology, but also by designing technological breakthroughs in other key areas such as 4G and 5G, precise positioning, machine learning, and computer vision,"" said Nakul Duggal, vice president, product management, automotive, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc . ""We are pleased to work with industry and government leaders, in our hometown, testing and refining the technologies for the more connected, automated vehicle of tomorrow and advanced cellular infrastructure which includes small cells and roadside units.""

""The San Diego Regional Proving Ground's partnership between SANDAG, Caltrans, and the City of Chula Vista positions us as leaders in the development and deployment of new technology, allowing our region to realize benefits in mobility, safety, and economic development. The collaboration this partnership demonstrates between government agencies and the private sector significantly reduces deployment costs while accelerating the proliferation of the infrastructure necessary for the next generation of mobility technology,"" said SANDAG Chair and County Supervisor Ron Roberts. ""Government will benefit from these new C-V2X roadside units integrated with cellular infrastructure, and San Diego is perfectly situated to provide a platform for new business models that can lead to safer roadways and more efficient operations.""

2017-10-28,VRTX,Intel Gains After Beating High Expectations -- Market Talk,"1351 ET - Intel , basking in the glow of a strong third-quarter report, is up more than 7.7% to $44.55. The results released Thursday show profit rising substantially owing to disciplined spending as the chip giant beat goals for operating expenditures, cut capital expenditures for the year, and raised its outlook for annual profit and per-share earnings. Matthew Ramsay of Canaccord Genuity sums up factors driving the stock move: ""The results across the board were quite good and, given that expectations were high, some folks are probably covering short positions today,"" he says. However, he also sounds a note of concern: Revenue growth in the data-center group came in well below the company's five-year target CAGR. (ted.greenwald@wsj.com)","1334 ET - The number of active oil rigs in the US rises by one to 737 in the latest week, a slight rebound from a four-month low it reached the prior week. The Baker Hughes data might suggest drillers are encouraged by oil prices that have stayed above $50/bbl for three weeks straight, although analysts say even higher prices are needed for activity to see another strong growth spurt. With today's data, the oil rig count has only risen twice in the past nine weeks. Meanwhile, the number of active natural gas rigs fall by 5 to 172. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

1325 ET - According to a couple of indexes that track billionaires, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has surpassed Bill Gates as the richest man in the world, again, as the online retail giant's stock prices surged after an earnings beat. Still, it's neck-in-neck as Microsoft 's stock prices rise, too, and it remains to be seen who will end the day in the lead. Bezos previously held the title for less than a day in July before Amazon reported earnings. (laura.stevens@wsj.com; @laurastevenswsj)

1321 ET - Automotive supplier Dana is on track to deliver its 2019 earnings plan a year early, thanks to strong demand for Jeep Wrangler SUVs, according to Barclays . Dana will benefit from Fiat Chrysler 's decision to continue production of the current Wrangler model into 2018 even as it ramps up output of a brand new version of its most iconic Jeep , the brokerage says. ""Conference calls with both Dana and FCA this week reinforce that there will be at least one quarter of dual [Wrangler model] production (and we think some potential to continue into 2Q'18),"" Barclays says. That will help Dana post estimated 2018 revenue of $7.6B and Ebitda of $941M, exceeding Dana's 2019 goals of $7.2B in revenue and Ebitda of $920M, the report says.

1312 ET - Wells Fargo says that now is ""NOT the time to throw in the towel,"" on Mattel , which is off 13.3% to $13.34 after a big 3Q miss, suspension of its dividend and new cost cutting to try to stabilize the company. While noting that 3Q results ""appear bad,"" the firm senses that the period represents ""the bottom tip,"" of what Mattel executives described would be a ""U"" shaped turnaround that should pick up momentum in 2H 2018. The firm also finds several positives in results, including that retail sales of core brands like Barbie remain strong. Mattel is also getting rid of underperforming and low margin brands, and has a greater management focus on profitability instead of empty sales and a simplified cost structure.

1312 ET - Mall landlords with a nationwide portfolio had an unprecedented 3Q as their shopping centers in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico faced hurricanes and flooding, while their assets in California faced dangers from fires. The Las Vegas mass shooting tragedy also affected tourist visits. ""(In) September, we dealt with a lot of crap,"" says David Simon , CEO of Simon Property , the world's largest REIT and the largest mall operator in the US, in an earnings call. ""We've never had malls where we had to shut because of fires."" Two of its malls in Puerto Rico remain closed for repairs while other malls have re-opened with regular operating hours. These malls are typically covered by insurance, and ultimately there wasn't a sales decline in the 3Q earnings in part due to the firm's geographic diversity, but Simon also noted that his staff had shown resilience and bravery in the face of tragedy to get these properties back up to serve their communities.

1232 ET - Canada's National Energy Board is reviewing a motion by Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd , challenging the ability of a town in British Columbia to block construction of a Trans Mountain pipeline extension. The NEB ""will take the time we need,"" to review the motion, says a department spokesman in an email to WSJ. Kinder Morgan on Thursday filed a motion with the federal government after failing to obtain municipal permits from the City of Burnaby to construct the pipeline. The NEB and the federal government had already approved expansion of the pipeline in 2016. (vipal.monga@wsj.com; @vipalmonga)

1207 ET - Mixed news for Airbus A320neo operators, with India's IndiGo reporting that all 26 of its jets are flying, but low-cost specialist Spirit Airlines is still only scheduling service with three of its five aircraft because of engine issues. ""The latest solution to alleviate the reliability issues has had some success, but it's too early to say this issue is fully resolved,"" said Spirit CFO Ed Christie on its 3Q call Thursday. Engine maker Pratt & Whitney , a unit of United Technologies , took a $196M charge in 3Q to compensate customers as it funneled more engines to act as spares rather than install on newly-delivered jets.

1154 ET - Among the Trump administration's self-inflicted wounds early after inauguration was its slowness in hiring staff for federal regulatory and other agencies, says Susan Ginsberg , VP of oil and natural gas regulatory affairs at the Washington-based Independent Petroleum Association of America . ""I don't know if it was distrust of the federal bureaucracy, or being an outsider in politics and thus simply not putting the pieces in place, but they hit the ground not running,"" she tells an energy conference audience in Dallas during a Q&A session. She says part of the staffing delays problem was due to an early reluctance by many in DC to be part of the Trump administration, compared with the typically spirited desire to join new presidential administrations. Some, she says, were worried being stamped as ""Trump loyalists"" could hurt them down the road. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

1142 ET - The good news for Colgate-Palmolive is that currency woes appear to have finally abated. The bad news: despite this, its financial results are weaker. Colgate reports tepid sales growth and a dip in net income, with none of the weakness attributed to currency headwinds. Noted one analyst on the quarterly earnings call: ""I don't recall a quarter where we've seen so much operating margin contraction in a favorable FX market."" (sharon.terlep@wsj.com)

1114 ET - Department store stocks fall after JC Penney lowers its 3Q guidance. Even though Penney's issues stemmed from a revamp of its women's apparel department, analysts remain cautious on department stores heading into the important holiday shopping season. Jefferies analyst Randal Konik noted in a report to clients that department stores as a group have resorted to higher discounts to lure shoppers in recent weeks, compared with the same period a year ago. ""We Remain Hesitant With Mall Based Dept Stores,"" Konik wrote. ""While we acknowledge the positive work JCP is doing to become less apparel reliant (with initiatives like the expansion of home, appliances, beauty, and salon) the sector faces intense secular headwinds as mall traffic wanes and the shift to e-comm should also continue to weigh on profitability."" Penney shares drop 15% (suzanne.kapner@wsj.com)

1100 ET - That was quick. Most US defense stocks recover some of Thursday's losses, which analysts had attributed to guides for 2018 sales and cash flow growth that were lighter than expected among many investors who'd driven the sector to recent record highs. L3 Technologies leads the pack, up 2% and wiping out the decline in the previous session. L3 on Thursday morning announced 3Q results and guided sales growth of 4%-5% next year, excluding the impact of the Vertex military maintenance unit now earmarked for sale. Most other prime contractors up today in line with the broader market. (doug.cameron@wsj.com; @dougcameron)

We are deeply grateful for the selfless dedication and commitment of our employees toward both restoring our businesses and supporting our communities during this unprecedented storm. We estimate that lost sales volumes valued at third quarter margins and additional related costs due to the storm impacted third quarter results by approximately $200 million. Margin improvements during September provided a partial offset to the lost production and higher costs,"" Patel said.

""During the third quarter, LyondellBasell advanced our growth strategy by opening a new polypropylene compounds plant in China and reaching final investment decision for our next propylene oxide (PO) plant while generating approximately $1.5 billion of cash flow from operating activity and returning $652 million to shareholders. With Standard & Poor's raising our senior unsecured debt to BBB+, the rating on our long-term debt now matches our strong corporate investment-grade credit ratings,"" said Patel.

OUTLOOK

""Hurricane Harvey reduced inventories across the petrochemical industry and contributed to further delays in the startup of new U.S. ethylene and derivative capacity. As the industry works to rebuild inventories during the fourth quarter, we expect global markets will remain tight to balanced for the remainder of 2017 and the industry will be better positioned to absorb capacity additions during 2018,"" Patel said.

Three months ended September 30, 2017 versus three months ended June 30, 2017 -- EBITDA decreased $243 million versus the second quarter 2017. Compared to the prior period, olefin results declined approximately $260 million. Ethylene margins fell approximately 5 cents per pound primarily due to increasing feedstock prices. Sales volumes also declined due to production outages related to Hurricane Harvey. Combined polyolefin results were relatively unchanged. Improvements in polyethylene volume and polyethylene spreads over ethylene were offset by reduced volumes in polypropylene combined with polypropylene prices lagging propylene price increases. Joint venture equity income decreased by $3 million.

Three months ended September 30, 2017 versus three months ended September 30, 2016 -- EBITDA decreased $66 million versus the third quarter 2016. Olefin results declined approximately $130 million primarily due to a decrease in ethylene margin from reduced ethylene price and increased feedstock costs. Net ethylene production increased 8 percent due to planned maintenance and expansion in the third quarter 2016 at Corpus Christi and planned maintenance at Morris which exceeded the Harvey volume impacts in the third quarter 2017. Combined polyolefin results increased approximately $40 million primarily due to a polyethylene spread improvement over ethylene of approximately 5 cents per pound. Joint venture equity income declined by $4 million.

Olefins and Polyolefins - Europe, Asia, and International (O&P-EAI) -- Our O&P--EAI segment produces and markets olefins and co-products, polyethylene and polypropylene, including polypropylene compounds.

Three months ended September 30, 2017 versus three months ended June 30, 2017 -- EBITDA decreased by $1 million versus the second quarter 2017. The third quarter benefited $108 million from the sale of LyondellBasell 's interest in Geosel. Olefin results decreased approximately $100 million primarily due to declining co-product prices. Combined polyolefin results decreased approximately $10 million with reduced margins partially offset by increased volume. Joint venture equity income was relatively unchanged.

Three months ended September 30, 2017 versus three months ended September 30, 2016 -- EBITDA increased by $114 million versus the third quarter 2016. The third quarter 2017 benefited $108 million from the sale of LyondellBasell 's interest in Geosel. Third quarter 2016 included an $11 million benefit from the restructuring of Asian polypropylene joint ventures and the sale of Australian polypropylene assets. Olefin results decreased by approximately $15 million as higher feedstock prices led to declining ethylene margins. Combined polyolefin results increased by approximately $10 million with increased sales volumes partially offset by declining polyethylene spreads. Joint venture equity income was relatively unchanged.

Three months ended September 30, 2017 versus three months ended June 30, 2017 -- EBITDA increased $63 million versus the second quarter 2017. PO and derivatives results increased approximately $25 million. Volumes improved resulting from the completion of planned maintenance at our plant in Botlek, The Netherlands in the second quarter which were partially offset by production losses in the third quarter due to Hurricane Harvey. Intermediate chemicals results increased approximately $15 million, primarily due to a 2 cent per pound improvement in styrene margins. Volumes declined for most intermediate chemicals except for an increase in methanol volumes due to the completion of second quarter planned maintenance. Oxyfuels and related products results increased by approximately $25 million primarily due to increased volumes from the completion of planned maintenance at Botlek. Joint venture equity income increased by $4 million.

Three months ended September 30, 2017 versus three months ended September 30, 2016 -- EBITDA increased $98 million versus the third quarter 2016. PO and derivatives results increased by approximately $35 million as both margins and volumes improved. Intermediate chemicals results increased by approximately $85 million primarily due to margin improvements in styrene, methanol and ethylene glycol which more than offset volume declines related to Hurricane Harvey. Oxyfuels and related products results declined by approximately $20 million primarily due to hurricane related production losses. Joint venture equity income was relatively unchanged.

Refining -- The primary products of this segment include gasoline and distillates, including diesel fuel, heating oil and jet fuel.

Three months ended September 30, 2017 versus three months ended June 30, 2017 -- EBITDA increased $33 million versus the second quarter 2017. The Houston refinery operated at 240,000 barrels per day, 25,000 barrels per day less than the prior quarter due to reduced rates as a result of Hurricane Harvey. A $2.27 increase in the Maya 2-1-1 to $21.81 was partially offset by unfavorable heavy to light differentials on by-product margins.

Three months ended September 30, 2017 versus three months ended September 30, 2016 -- EBITDA increased $68 million versus the third quarter 2016. Third quarter 2017 throughput increased by 31,000 barrels per day with operational disruptions in the third quarter of 2016 exceeding reduced rates in the third quarter 2017 due to Hurricane Harvey. A $2.83 increase in the Maya 2-1-1 to $21.81 was partially offset by unfavorable heavy to light differentials on by-product margins.

INFORMATION RELATED TO FINANCIAL MEASURES

This release makes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

EBITDA, as presented herein, may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure reported by other companies due to differences in the way the measure is calculated. We calculate EBITDA as income from continuing operations plus interest expense (net), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation & amortization. EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to profit or operating profit for any period as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to operating cash flows as a measure of our liquidity.

Quantitative reconciliations of EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, are provided in Table 8 at the end of this release.

Joint venture to combine Mitsubishi 's global brand recognition and local enterprise expertise with Digital Realty's global data center platform and industry-leading operational track record","PR Newswire

SINGAPORE, Oct. 23, 2017

SINGAPORE, Oct. 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Digital Realty (NYSE: DLR), a leading global provider of data centre, colocation and interconnection solutions, announced today it has entered into a 50/50 joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation to provide data centre solutions in Japan. The new joint venture will benefit from Mitsubishi Corporation 's local enterprise expertise and established data center presence in Tokyo, as well as Digital Realty's global client base and industry-leading track record of data centre operational excellence.

The joint venture will operate under the name MC Digital Realty. Mitsubishi Corporation will contribute two existing data centre facilities in the western Tokyo suburb of Mitaka, while Digital Realty will contribute its recently completed data centre development project in Osaka. The three seed assets are collectively valued at approximately 40 billion Japanese Yen, or approximately $350 million. The joint venture aims to build a meaningful platform to serve the broader Japanese market, with the potential to significantly expand its scope over the next several years.

""We are delighted to be partnering with an institution of Mitsubishi Corporation 's global prestige and local expertise, and to be establishing a presence in Tokyo,"" said A. William Stein , Digital Realty's Chief Executive Officer. ""Japan is a highly strategic country for Digital Realty's global data centre platform, and this relationship with Mitsubishi Corporation represents a major step towards strengthening our presence in Japan.""

Digital Realty announced the opening of Digital Osaka 1, its first data centre project in Japan, earlier this year. Digital Osaka 1 spans approximately 93,000 square feet, provides 7.6 megawatts of IT capacity, and was fully leased prior to the official opening. Concurrent with the opening of Digital Osaka 1, Digital Realty also announced the acquisition of an adjacent land parcel for the future development of a connected campus in Osaka, which will support up to 27 megawatts of additional IT capacity upon completion.

""Japan is a developed market, with a highly advanced technology sector that is expected to experience rapid growth over the next several years, yet the local data centre market remains highly fragmented with a shortage of institutional quality data centre capacity,"" said Chris Kenney, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President, International. ""We see tremendous opportunity for growth in the Asia Pacific region over the next several years, and we expect the MC Digital Realty joint venture will significantly enhance our ability to meet the growing data centre demands of the Japanese market.""

Digital Realty offers a full range of global data centre, colocation and interconnection solutions, and currently owns and operates 157 properties across 33 global metropolitan areas. In the Asia Pacific region, Digital Realty operates a network of industry-leading data centres located in Singapore, Hong Kong, Osaka, Melbourne and Sydney.

Canada NewsWire","SANTA MONICA, Calif. and MUMBAI, India, Oct. 23, 2017

Company Expands International Content Platform into World's Fastest Growing Media Market

SANTA MONICA, Calif. and MUMBAI, India, Oct. 23, 2017 /CNW/ -- Global content leader Lionsgate (NYSE: LGF.A, LGF.B) has named leading media executive and entrepreneur Rohit Jain , a 20-year veteran of the Indian media industry, to head its new office in Mumbai, India, the Company announced today.

Jain has served for the past seven years as Deputy CEO of Videocon d2h , a media company that he helped grow from a start-up to over $1 billion in annual revenues through a combination of organic growth and strategic transactions. Jain helped orchestrate Videocon's successful listing on Nasdaq in 2015 followed by the announcement of its merger with Dish TV India in 2016.

Lionsgate India will spearhead all licensing to local linear and digital platforms in the territory from feature films, television series and library content under the Lionsgate and Starz brands. It will work closely with the studio's theatrical distribution partners to maximize box office for Lionsgate films, and it will partner with local production companies to develop intellectual property for theatrical release as well as distribution across other media platforms. Lionsgate India will also explore investment opportunities throughout the Indian media market.

Boasting the world's second largest consumer population and fastest-growing middle class, India has achieved double-digit annual growth across television, film, interactive games and delivery of content to digital platforms. With over 800 television channels, more than 30 over-the-top platforms, 8,500 theatrical exhibition screens and an evolving interactive game business, opportunities for content producers and distributors are continuing to increase.

""We've been focused on the enormous opportunity created by the Indian marketplace for years, and Rohit checks off all the boxes as the right executive to lead our business there,"" said Lionsgate Chief Executive Officer Jon Feltheimer . ""Lionsgate brings to this territory a global content platform, an entrepreneurial mind set, and the agility of a next generation digital age company. Rohit is ideally qualified to leverage these strengths into accelerating growth and new business initiatives in the years ahead.""

""I'm thrilled to join Jon and the rest of the Lionsgate team as we continue to build the Company's brand in India,"" said Jain. ""India is the next logical frontier for Lionsgate's multiplatform content creation, marketing expertise and digital initiatives, and I'm incredibly excited at the opportunities that lie ahead.""

Prior to his tenure at Videocon, Jain worked at Aon , PricewaterhouseCoopers and Deloitte.

Lionsgate has been steadily expanding its global content platform with the continued growth of Lionsgate UK into a leading film and television production and distribution company, a growing operation in China that has established strong relationships with nearly all major platforms in the territory and increased the studio's box office gross by 63% from last year, and a new Canadian office that was opened in Toronto earlier this year.

In the past few years, the Company has tripled its revenue from India and launched the hit Hindi-language film Brothers, a remake of Lionsgate's critically-acclaimed Warrior. A Hindi-language remake of the studio's action hit comedy Red is also in the works. Rohit Tiwari of Morris Street Advisors, who had previously served as Lionsgate's local sales agent in India, has transitioned to a consulting relationship to Lionsgate India.""

ABOUT LIONSGATE

The first major new studio in decades, Lionsgate is a global content platform whose films, television series, digital products and linear and over-the-top platforms reach next generation audiences around the world. In addition to its filmed entertainment leadership, Lionsgate content drives a growing presence in interactive and location-based entertainment, gaming, virtual reality and other new entertainment technologies. Lionsgate's content initiatives are backed by a 16,000-title film and television library and delivered through a global licensing infrastructure.

Highlights ""shareholders would be best served by supporting the election of all three of Pershing Square's nominees""","Notes ADP's ""response and communications during this campaign, including the stated goals under the board's plan, fail to acknowledge the magnitude of the opportunity""

Agrees that Pershing Square ""has argued the more convincing case"" and outlines ""substantial opportunity for ADP and its shareholders to realize superior returns and value in the long term"" 


NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 23, 2017-- 

Pershing Square Capital Management , L.P . (""Pershing Square""), announced today that Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (""Glass Lewis""), a leading proxy advisory firm, recommends that ADP (NASDAQ: ADP) shareholders vote FOR Pershing Square's three nominees on the GOLD proxy card at ADP's annual meeting November 7, 2017.

In recommending Pershing Square's nominees on the GOLD proxy card, Glass Lewis noted:

""[W]e believe Pershing Square has argued the more convincing case, particularly that: (i) ADP is underperforming its potential; (ii) ADP's historical leadership position and scale advantages breed complacency with incremental improvements that accrue relatively easily year after year; (iii) ADP is not keeping pace with smaller competitors in key market segments in the evolving HCM industry; (iv) an inefficient corporate structure and insular culture restrain ADP from identifying and urgently responding to business opportunities and threats; and (v) ADP's performance can be significantly improved, and shareholder returns enhanced, pursuant to a transformation plan implemented in a prudent manner under the oversight of a partly reconstituted board of directors. In our view, the board's response, or lack thereof, to the substance of Pershing Square's argument leaves much to be desired by shareholders and, similarly, the board's stated operational and financial plan strikes us as being inadequate and underwhelming given the substantial opportunity thoroughly detailed by Pershing Square.""

The highly qualified nominees for ADP's transformation on the Glass Lewis-recommended GOLD card are: William A. Ackman , CEO of Pershing Square; Veronica M. Hagen , former CEO of Polymer Group, Inc.; and V. Paul Unruh , presently director and Chairman of the Audit Committee at Symantec Corporation.

Bill Ackman said, ""We are extremely pleased to receive such a strong endorsement from Glass Lewis. We urge our fellow shareholders to follow Glass Lewis' recommendation and vote the GOLD proxy card for all three nominees for ADP's transformation.""

At the end of this release, please find additional excerpts from the Glass Lewis report.* Please contact Glass Lewis directly for the complete report.

Pershing Square published its most recent ADP presentation on October 11, 2017. Shareholders can access that presentation here and additional supporting materials here.

To vote for Pershing Square's Nominees for ADP's Transformation, please vote the GOLD Proxy Card or GOLD Voting Instruction Form.

You can vote by Internet, telephone or by signing and dating the GOLD Proxy Card or Voting Instruction Form and mailing it in the postage paid envelope provided. We urge you NOT to vote using any white proxy card or voting instruction form you receive from ADP. Please discard the white proxy card.

Details from the Glass Lewis Report:

Summary Recommendations:

[W]e believe Pershing Square has articulated a compelling case that, despite ADP's strong historical track record and consistent delivery of incremental improvements, the Company is not performing to its full potential, operationally or financially, and is not maximizing value for long-term shareholders. In our view, when compared to the productivity, profitability and growth of ADP's competitors in the HCM industry -- or to businesses that previously operated within ADP and upon being spun out achieved significant improvements in these key performance metrics -- the substantial opportunity that Pershing Square has outlined for ADP to potentially achieve becomes readily apparent. The Company's response and communications during this campaign, including the stated goals under the board's plan, fail to acknowledge the magnitude of the opportunity, in our view, or the risks inherent in the Company's own plan. We believe the board's approach could prove to be value destructive going forward if there is insufficient focus on defending and strengthening ADP's competitive position and leveraging its massive scale and resource advantages.

Therefore, we see a reasonable basis to support the Dissident's solicitation for minority board representation. Under the oversight of a partly refreshed board, we believe the implementation of the Dissident's transformation plan would likely lead to the realization of superior financial performance and significantly greater value for ADP shareholders than that which might be expected to accrue to shareholders pursuant to the board's plan. In order to effect meaningful change and give the board a clear mandate to more urgently pursue strategic, operational and financial improvements at ADP, we believe support for all three of the Dissident's nominees is warranted.

[...]

[W]e believe the Dissident's nominees would each and collectively bring a fresh independent perspective, new ideas, recent and practical experience achieving operational efficiencies, implementing a business transformation plan and realizing cost savings, as well as financial expertise and an owner's mentality to the ADP board. These experiences and perspectives appear to be well-suited for ADP's current opportunities and threats giving rise to the potential for the Company to strengthen its competitive position and meaningfully improve its operational and financial performance. The nominees, each a qualified director candidate with a clear financial incentive to represent the interests of all ADP shareholders, would represent a minority of three in a boardroom of 10 directors. As such, they would be in no position to advance any substantive change that was also not also supported by at least an equal number, and likely a majority, of the remaining incumbent board members. At the same time, the election of three new board members, effecting the replacement of the three longest-tenured directors, would arm the Dissident's nominees with a strong directive from ADP shareholders for the board and management team to work constructively in order to maximize ADP's potential.

[...]

Therefore, rather than supporting the status quo, we believe investors have an opportunity to convey their discontent with the board's continuation of a potentially sub-optimal business plan, and to encourage fresh perspectives, analysis and discussion in the boardroom of the best path forward for ADP, through the election of qualified director candidates, including a well-established shareholder representative, supported by what we believe to be convincing, well-framed arguments outlining the substantial opportunity for ADP and its shareholders to realize superior returns and value in the long term. Based on these factors and the considerations discussed above, we believe shareholders would be best served by supporting the election of all three of Pershing Square's nominees as well as the re-election of the seven uncontested incumbent nominees.

Accordingly, we recommend that shareholders vote FOR all nominees on the GOLD proxy card.

The Nominees for ADP's Transformation:

[W]e agree with the Dissident's assessment that the ADP board appears to be lacking in business transformation and operating efficiency experience, which forms the basis of Pershing Square's nomination of Ms. Hagen and Mr. Unruh. Furthermore, in nominating Mr. Ackman, Pershing Square believes his election would address a lack of significant stock ownership by the incumbent directors, promote an owner's mentality in the boardroom and add the perspective of an investor who has been involved in several business transformations.

Regarding Veronica M. Hagen :

[W]e believe Ms. Hagen's executive and director experience at companies across a variety of competitive industries, including engineered materials, pulp and paper, aluminum, utilities, and mining, businesses which generally have lower margins and require an intense focus on operational efficiency in order to be successful, would be applicable and valuable to ADP's current position, and generally aligned with Pershing Square's objectives.

Regarding V. Paul Unruh :

Similarly, Mr. Unruh's director experience, recently and most notably at Symantec Corp ., where as a member of a board sub-committee he oversaw the implementation of a cost and business transformation plan that generated significant cost savings, would likely prove instrumental to the implementation of a transformation plan at ADP, seeking to replicate the success achieved by Symantec and also realized by CDK following its spin-off from ADP. Further, Mr. Unruh's financial and accounting experience, including as a chairman or member of public company audit committees, would immediately fill such a need should all three contested incumbents, including the current chairman of the audit committee, be replaced.

Regarding Bill Ackman :

Press Release: Proxy Advisory Firm Glass Lewis -2-

In consideration of Mr. Ackman's candidacy more directly, we find it somewhat necessary to note Pershing Square's strong overall track record of engagement and activism, at companies across industries, where the firm generally takes a longer-term view and promotes value-creating strategies. The ADP board attempts to discredit Pershing Square's case against ADP by highlighting a select few of the investment firm's higher-profile losses at Valeant, J.C. Penney , Target and Borders. Aside from being largely irrelevant to the substance of Pershing Square's critique of ADP's business, the defense tactic is entirely one-sided as it ignores Pershing Square's successes. Most notably, as it relates to Pershing Square's transformation plan for ADP, the investment firm's bigger wins include Canadian Pacific , Zoetis and Air Products , situations in which Pershing Square also pushed for operational transformations, resulting in either the election or appointment of new board members, improved operational efficiency, higher profit margins and the creation of shareholder value. Ironically, the current chairman of the ADP board, Mr. Jones, was previously the CEO and chairman of Air Products, having retired approximately five years before Pershing Square agitated for the replacement of Mr. Jones' successor at Air Products .

Glass Lewis' analysis also notes the following:

ADP's Total Shareholder Returns:

Upon review, we consider several of the Company's reported TSR figures to be overstated, and the Company's TSR comparisons to be less relevant than those presented in the Dissident's materials. As Pershing Square points out, the Company's TSR figures exclude the negative stock price movement immediately after Mr. Rodriguez was named CEO, inappropriately include the return generated by CDK after it was spun off by ADP and under the control of a new board and separate management team, or are compared to the average returns of a peer set heavily skewed toward the largest and least comparable companies included in the Company-defined peer set.

[...]

[W]e find ADP's TSR performance to be far less impressive than touted by the board and management. Most notably, ADP's total returns are either merely consistent with or meaningfully lower than the average returns of the Company's closest HCM competitors.

[...]

However, when ADP's total returns are calculated appropriately and objectively, and judged in proper context against a peer set consisting of the most directly comparable publicly-listed companies that compete with ADP in the HCM industry, ADP's TSR performance is not as strong as the Company claims. To be sure, that's not to say that ADP has performed worst in class, far from it. We see that ADP has delivered something closer to middle-of-the-pack returns over the periods presented, including below-average returns for the last three years when compared to either the Dissident's or the Company's peer set. In our opinion, this analysis ultimately supports the Dissident's view that ADP has not delivered returns consistent with its leading competitive position in an attractive industry with numerous tailwinds and, more broadly, supports the Dissident's overall thesis that that ADP is not performing to its full potential.

ADP's Response to Pershing Square:

In response to Pershing Square's operational critique, ADP touts multi-year growth rates in revenue and earnings and operating margin expansion realized over the last five or six years. However, upon closer inspection, similar to the TSR figures touted by the Company, we find that several of the Company's key data points are based on selectively chosen periods or inconsistent calculation methodologies in order to make ADP's performance appear stronger. For example, while ADP claims a revenue CAGR of 7.3% accompanied by operating margin expansion of 580 basis points over the last five years, the calculation actually appears to be taken over the last six years and, more importantly, those figures are calculated inconsistently with respect to the treatment of PEO pass-throughs. The Company includes pass-throughs for the revenue growth rate and nets them for the change in operating margin, in each case resulting in a higher figure than the alternative methodology. If these metrics are calculated consistently, the result is either a lower revenue CAGR of 5.8% (net of PEO pass-throughs) to go along with the stated margin expansion or lower margin expansion of 380 basis points (gross of PEO pass-throughs) to go along with the stated revenue growth rate.

[...]

In our view, any way the Company may attempt to present it, a fair apples-to-apples comparison placed within the proper context clearly indicates the substantial opportunity for ADP to improve its operational performance. The Company's selective presentation of certain metrics, calculated inconsistently or without context, purportedly to make ADP's absolute or relative performance appear better, in this case is a tactic which considerably weakens the Company's defense, in our view. This is particularly true here considering the Dissident's thorough and fairly-presented critique of the underlying operational performance of ADP's Employer Services business given the publicly available data. Moreover, the Company's lack of a substantive response to several of the Dissident's arguments, including a series of questions raised by Pershing Square during this campaign with respect to ADP's operational performance (such as ADP's profit margins in Employer Services by sub-segment), suggests that particularly convincing evidence to refute the Dissident's critique does not exist.

CDK and Solera:

Pershing Square sees further evidence of opportunity for ADP to perform better in the dramatic improvements in profitability realized by ADP's former Claims Services business, now Solera, and Dealer Services business, now CDK, after their sale and spin-off by ADP. Specifically, each of Solera and, more recently, CDK effectively doubled their respective operating margins to 35% or 40% within five years after being separated from ADP. In our view, the Solera and CDK cases are perhaps the most compelling evidence of the ADP board's sub-optimal business oversight and the validity of the opportunity asserted by Pershing Square for ADP's Employer Services to substantially improve its performance given more effective board oversight, proper direction, a different mentality and a new operating plan.

ADP's Transformation Plan:

On the one hand, the current directors propose a ""steady as she goes"" approach, representing a reaffirmation of the Company's current direction, which targets incremental improvements in ADP's operational and financial performance.

[...]

Upon closer scrutiny, ADP's three-year plan calls for only approximately 300 basis points in net operating margin expansion, and only 220 basis points of margin expansion in Employer Services, which is consistent with ADP's historical performance and long-term plan of delivering 50 to 100 basis points per year. Upon review, we find the Company's plan to be underwhelming in this regard, as does Pershing Square, other ADP shareholders we spoke with and certain analysts who follow the Company.

Pershing Square's Transformation Plan:

Where the Dissident's plan does involve product migrations, primarily in the enterprise market segment, where ADP appears to be losing ground because of its inability to develop a competitive product offering, the Dissident's plan involves critical, though necessary, product migrations. Here, the Dissident has proposed sensible and risk-mitigating initiatives to address legacy client issues, such as moving many of ADP's legacy enterprise clients to the company's existing Workforce Now product platform, an idea the Dissident believes the Company has now adopted since Pershing Square first suggested it.

[...]

In our opinion, the CDK case is indeed comparable, instructive and telling of the substantial opportunity that resides within ADP's Employer Services business today. While the Company's plan to improve the performance of its Employer Services business shares some similarities with the transformation plan proposed by Pershing Square and the transformation plan previously implemented by CDK post-spin, management's plan doesn't go far enough, in our view. Rather, the board's plan fails to acknowledge the magnitude of the opportunity, does not appear to appreciate the extent and pace at which several separate but related initiatives must be pursued to achieve meaningful improvements and does not convey a practical understanding of the steps required to identify, validate, quantify and achieve operational and financial improvements. Therefore, we find Pershing Square's plan to be a realistic yet far more compelling proposal that, while not as conservative as the Company's approach, remains prudent and measured, centered primarily on basic business blocking and tackling.

   PR Newswire 
 
 
   ST. LOUIS, Oct. 2, 2017 
 
 
   ST. LOUIS, Oct. 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Express Scripts  (NASDAQ: ESRX) 
today introduced a new Express Scripts Medicare(R) Prescription Drug 
Plan (PDP) for 2018 called the Saver plan, a low-premium Part D plan 
that provides affordable access to nearly 3,000 commonly used 
medications and a preferred pharmacy network with CVS Pharmacy  and the 
Kroger Family of Pharmacies. 
 
 
   ""When it comes to a Medicare Part D plan, there is no such thing as one 
size fits all. Express Scripts ' ability to work with different partners 
across the pharmacy supply chain allows us to create a variety of 
valuable plans that provide safe, high-quality access to prescription 
medications for all seniors,"" said Jennie Knisley, vice president, 
Medicare prescription drug plans, Express Scripts. ""Our new Saver plan 
is a low-cost option for seniors who need a plan that provides the 
essentials and helps them affordably avoid delayed enrollment penalties, 
while our Choice and Value plans provide broader medication access and 
preferred pharmacy options for seniors with more complex medication 
needs."" 
 
 
   The Saver plan offers a low premium of $22.60 per month[1] -- less than 
$1 per day -- and a $0 deductible on tier 1 and tier 2 generics. Copays 
are $1 for tier 1 generic medications and $4 for tier 2 generic 
medications when filled at one of more than 8,000 CVS pharmacies or more 
than 2,000 Kroger  pharmacies nationwide. The copays for a 90-day supply 
of tier 1 or tier 2 generic medications are just $2 and $8, respectively, 
via home delivery by the Express Scripts Pharmacy(SM) . 
 
 
   In addition to the Saver plan, the Express Scripts Medicare Value and 
Choice plans, currently rated 4 Stars(2) , provide a more comprehensive 
formulary and cover up to 75 percent of the costs, after the deductible, 
for specialty medications -- high-cost drugs that treat complex, chronic 
conditions. The Choice plan also will provide coverage in the Gap for a 
select group of tier 3 brand drugs above the standard gap coverage in 
2018. 
 
 
   Both the Value and Choice plans will continue providing additional cost 
savings through a preferred pharmacy network that features more than 
8,200 Walgreens  pharmacies, 2,000 Kroger  pharmacies and more than more 
than 12,000 independent pharmacies nationwide. 
 
 
   ""Express Scripts Medicare plans are built on more than a decade of 
experience providing care to millions of Medicare beneficiaries,"" said 
Knisley. ""All enrollees have 24/7 access to Express Scripts  pharmacists 
to answer prescription medication questions, and access to our 
specialist pharmacists and nurses who have enhanced condition-specific 
training and experience, and offer patients with ongoing personalized 
care and support to ensure optimal health outcomes."" 
 
 
   Enrollment for the 2018 plan year begins October 15, 2017 and ends 
December 7, 2017. Coverage begins on January 1, 2018.  Saver, Choice and

2017-10-03,SRE,*Fitch Rates Oncor's Senior Secured Notes 'BBB+'; Ratings on Positive Watch,"2 Oct 2017 12:26 ET 
Press Release: Fitch Rates Oncor's Senior Secured Notes 'BBB+'; Ratings on Positive Watch


 
 
The following is a press release from Fitch Ratings : 
 ","Fitch Ratings-New York-02 October 2017: Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating/Rating Watch Positive to Oncor Electric Delivery Company, LLC 's (Oncor) $325 million 3.80% senior secured notes due 2047. Fitch placed Oncor on Rating Watch Positive following the announcement by Sempra Energy (IDR 'BBB+'/Outlook Stable) to acquire, along with a consortium of investors, 100% of the equity of reorganized Energy Future Holdings Corp . (EFH). EFH indirectly owns an 80% equity interest in Oncor.

Oncor plans to use the net proceeds from the issuance to redeem a portion of the $324.4 million 5.00% senior secured notes due 2017, repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility, which totalled $1.156 billion as of June 30, 2017, and for general corporate purposes.

Fitch will likely resolve the Rating Watch and the constrained notching of the senior secured debt at or close to the completion of the transaction. The transaction is subject to receiving approval from the bankruptcy court of EFH's amended reorganization plan, the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), and the Private Letter Ruling from the IRS confirming the tax-free nature of the transaction. Approvals are also needed from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and under Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act.Ã

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Regulatory Approval is Key: Sempra intends to apply for PUCT's approval for the change of control shortly. Its merger agreement has been approved by the bankruptcy court. Fitch currently does not anticipate any significant customer concessions as part of the merger approval process; the ring fencing provisions, $3 billion of debt at reorganized EFH and the governance structure at both Oncor and its direct parent, Oncor Electric Delivery Holdings Company LLC (Oncor Holdings), would likely occupy greater attention in the merger proceedings. The acquisition by Sempra , if completed, will finally resolve the drawn-out bankruptcy proceedings for Oncor's indirect parent holding company. Fitch has been constraining the Oncor's IDR one-notch below its peer utilities in Texas and has further constrained the senior secured debt an additional notch.

Sempra has agreed to the same set of regulatory commitments as proposed by Berkshire Hathaway Energy during their planned acquisition of Oncor with a key difference being that Sempra 's transaction contemplates $3 billion of debt at reorganized EFH. However, Sempra has committed to pay off that debt in seven years or less and not to incur any additional debt at that level. The other proposed regulatory commitments ensure that Oncor remains tightly ring-fenced to address the PUCT's clear preference for a strong independent board at Oncor, a factor that had become a sticking point in the last change of control proceeding involving Nextera Energy, Inc . These commitments include majority independent boards at both Oncor and Oncor Holdings with significant rights with respect to dividend and capital investment decisions. Sempra has also committed that Oncor's credit rating at the time of transaction closing will be the same or better than that at June 30th and, in addition, has offered to suspend dividends if Oncor's senior secured debt is rated below 'BBB' by any of the three rating agencies. Sempra will also work with the other owners to infuse equity in Oncor within 180 days of closing of the transaction so as to achieve a 42.5% equity ratio, which is in line with the settlement reached recently in Oncor's rate case proceeding. Finally, as per the merger agreement, Texas Transmission Inc. can continue as a minority holder in Oncor with approximately 20% ownership interest.

Strong Performance to Continue; Oncor continues to deliver strong operational and financial performance; the latter is driven by a combination of sales growth and significant transmission investments backed with constructive recovery mechanisms. Weather-adjusted residential sales and large commercial and industrial (C&I) sales continue to be robust despite the muted oil and gas related activity in Texas as compared to prior years. Residential points of delivery have seen a robust annual growth of 1.9% for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2017. Demand from large commercial and industrial (C&I) customers increased 1.3% in the most recent quarter compared to the year ago period.

Rate Case Settlement Marginally Positive: On March 17, 2017, Oncor filed a rate case request with the PUCT to increase its transmission and distribution rates by approximately $317 million (a 7.5% increase) based upon a capital structure of 55% debt and 45% equity (versus 60/40 currently) and return on equity of 10.25% (same as currently authorized). The rate increase request was primarily driven by recovery of approximately $7.9 billion of investments made since June 30, 2010, the end of its most recent rate case test year, and increase in O&M costs over this period. In addition, Oncor is also seeking recovery of over $1 billion in regulatory assets. Oncor reached a settlement with the PUCT staff and key intervenors that allows for a 3.4% rate increase for Oncor effective Nov. 27, 2017 based on a 42.5% equity ratio and 9.8% ROE. However, the timing for implementation of the new regulatory capital structure has not been determined yet. Oncor also agreed to exchange certain assetsÃ withÃ Sharyland Distribution & Transmission Services L.L.C. (SDTS), whereby SDTS will provide certain distribution assets and limited transmission assets to Oncor (approximately $401 million book value), and Oncor will provide certain transmission assets (approximately $380 million book value) plus the difference in book value as cash to SDTS. The transaction and rate case settlement is subject to the PUCT approval. The transaction is also subject to the receipt of consent from SDTS lenders, and clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act. The transaction has already received approval from the bankruptcy court.

Stable Credit Metrics: For the last 12-months ending June 30, 2017, Oncor reported FFO interest charge coverage ratio of 5.3x, and adjusted debt to EBITDAR of 3.8x. These metrics are strong compared to a median financial profile of a 'BBB' regulated transmission and distribution utility.Fitch estimates Oncor's FFO Interest coverage to remain approximately 5.0x and adjusted debt to EBITDAR to remain approximately 4.0x over 2017-2021. Oncor is planning to spend approximately $1.5 billion in capex in 2017 and more than $1.6 billion annually over 2018-2021. Transmission capex is approximately 50% of the total projected capex and various tracker mechanisms allow Oncor to earn a return on transmission related capital investment with minimal regulatory lag.

DERIVATION SUMMARY

Fitch has been constraining Oncor's IDR by one-notch compared to its peer transmission and distribution utilities in Texas, which include CenterPoint Houston Electric Inc. (CEHE; IDR: BBB+/Outlook Stable) and AEP Texas Inc. (BBB+/Outlook Stable). The notching of the senior secured debt at Oncor has been further constrained to reflect Oncor's ownership by a bankrupt parent that limits Oncor's access to equity to retention of dividend. The adjusted debt to EBITDAR for Oncor (approximately 4.0x) is weaker compared to CEHE (3.5x) given a lower proportion of equity in the approved regulatory capital structure (40% versus CEHE's 45%) and relatively higher capex. Oncor's adjusted debt to EBITDAR is better than AEP Texas (4.5x) due to proportionately higher capex at the latter and similar regulatory capital structure. Oncor's last authorized return on equity was 10.25% compared to 10.0% at CEHE and 9.96% at AEP Texas. If the recent settlement stipulation is approved by the PUCT, Oncor's equity ratio will increase to 42.5% but authorized ROE will decline to 9.8%.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for Oncor include:

--No material customer concessions required as part of PUCT's approval for the Sempra acquisition;

--Volumetric sales growth of 1% p.a. in 2017 and 1.5% thereafter;

--O&M costs inflated at 3% annually;

--Recent settlement stipulation approved by the PUCT;

--Regulatory capital structure of 57.5% debt and 42.5% equity and rate increase in 2020;

--Capex of $1.5 billion in 2017 and then $1.6 billion annually till 2021;

--Pension funding of $740 million from 2017 - 2021.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action

--Conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings of EFH;

--Continued commitment by Sempra to pay off the debt at reorganized EFH within seven years; and

--Strengthening of the current ring-fencing provisions.

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action

--Weak ring-fencing provisions that lead to a close rating linkage between Oncor and a weak parent;

--Material amount of debt above Oncor Holdings with limited visibility on deleveraging;

--Adverse outcomes in future rate cases such as significant sharing of tax benefits with ratepayers or material reduction in authorized ROEs;

--Sustained weakness in total adjusted debt to EBITDAR measures above 4.5x.

LIQUIDITY

Oncor's $2 billion corporate revolving facility is due October 2018. Fitch expects Oncor to extend the maturity of revolver and secure commitments from its bank group on a timely basis. Under the terms of the corporate revolver, the lenders' commitments are several and not joint.

2 Oct 2017 12:26 ET 
Press Release: Fitch Rates Oncor's Senior Secured -2-

As of June 30, 2017, Oncor had $1.16 billion of borrowings under the revolving credit facility and $9 million of outstanding LCs. The drawn balances are large and reflect a high capex spend; Oncor typically draws on its corporate revolver to fund capital work in progress and subsequently replaces the drawn balances with permanent financing and/or internally generated funds. Since EFH filed for bankruptcy protection, Oncor has accessed debt markets on several occasions to term out its revolver. Fitch believes Oncor continues to have access to debt markets to refinance or issue new debt.

The first posterior approach, zero-profile, lumbar cage featuring integrated, self-guided plating","PR Newswire

WARSAW, Ind., Oct. 2, 2017

WARSAW, Ind., Oct. 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc . (NYSE and SIX: ZBH), a global leader in musculoskeletal healthcare, today announced it is officially launching in the United States the Avenue(R) T TLIF Cage. Avenue T advances posterior lumbar cage technology by incorporating VerteBRIDGE(R) plating, which facilitates simplified cage insertion and zero-profile, intradiscal fixation through a direct, minimally invasive surgical (MIS) approach. Avenue T is the first and only posteriorly implanted cage with integrated, anti-migration fixation, solidifying Zimmer Biomet as the first company to offer a suite of lumbar cages with integrated fixation for every fusion approach. Avenue T joins a family of cages with VerteBRIDGE plating, including ROI-C(R) Cervical Cage, Avenue(R) L Lateral Lumbar Cage and ROI-A(R) ALIF Cage.

Dr. Craig Chebuhar, a board-certified orthopaedic spine surgeon in Atlanta, Georgia, who implanted one of the first Avenue T cages in the U.S., commented, ""I regularly use Zimmer Biomet 's ROI-C Cervical Cage featuring VerteBRIDGE plating in my practice. Transforaminal lumbar surgery is another attractive application for integrated plating. For my TLIF patients, I appreciate the additional fixation VerteBRIDGE provides to the construct, all via a minimally invasive approach.""

The Avenue T Cage is a prime example of Zimmer Biomet 's commitment to the advancement of MIS surgery. The Avenue T Cage and self-guided, curved VerteBRIDGE plating are delivered in the plane of the disc through a simplified technique. The VerteBRIDGE plates are sterile packaged and pre-assembled on a PEEK cartridge. The cartridge simplifies the technique, enabling the cage and plates to be loaded simultaneously on the Inserter. Once the cage is implanted, the Impactor advances both plates at the same time, reducing implantation steps. The unique anterior column fixation provided by the plating may permit the surgeon to select from a greater array of options for supplemental fixation.

Indications: The Avenue T TLIF Cage system is indicated for intervertebral body fusion of the lumbar spine, from L2 to S1, in skeletally mature patients who have had six months of non-operative treatment. The device is intended for use at either one level or two contiguous levels for the treatment of degenerative disc disease (DDD) with up to Grade I spondylolisthesis or retrolisthesis. DDD is defined as back pain of discogenic origin with degeneration of the disc confirmed by history and radiographic studies. The Avenue T TLIF Cage is designed for use with or without integrated fixation and must be used in conjunction with supplemental fixation cleared by FDA for use in the lumbar spine. The device is implanted via a transforaminal approach and intended for use with autograft to facilitate fusion.

1121 ET - Barclays says the ""value proposition of games remains very high relative to other forms of media."" The brokerage thinks digital distribution will help grow the industry from $85B today to $109B by 2020. As such, it starts coverage of Electronic Arts , Activision and Take-Two Interactive . It rates EA overweight with a $129 price target, saying it's bullish its margin-expansion opportunity and accelerating digital-revenue growth.

1054 ET - Tuesday's eye-popping news that Yahoo 's 2013 cybersecurity breach actually affected all of its 3B users, not the 1B originally disclosed, won't affect the terms of Verizon 's recent $4.5B purchase of Yahoo . A person familiar with the matter tells WSJ that Verizon assumed the 1B breach affected all of Yahoo 's users when it negotiated for a $350M discount off the initial $4.8B price tag. Yahoo 's entire user base has already been forced to reset their passwords, so victims won't need to take additional action. Verizon and Altaba, which sold Yahoo , share liability for consumer lawsuits and Altaba retains liability for government investigations. (ryan.knutson@wsj.com; @ryan_knutson)

1038 ET - Brazil's antitrust agency, Cade, expresses concern that Bayer AG 's proposed $57B takeover of Monsanto could lead to ""significant"" concentration in one of the world's largest markets for crop seeds. ""With the acquisition of Monsanto , Bayer will become dominant in key parts of the chain of the main crops, strengthening the company's position in a worrisome way,"" Cade's general superintendent said in a technical report. The report was sent to Cade's full council, which has about five months to decide whether to approve the deal, block it, or say what must be done to address the concerns raised.

1027 ET - Monsanto executives say they remain upbeat about the fate of the company's flagship herbicide in Europe, despite signs of growing opposition. The EU is due to decide by mid-December on whether to renew its approval of the weedkiller glyphosate, after last year issuing a temporary extension amid fresh debate over the chemical's potential to cause cancer. France in September said it would vote against extending glyphosate's approval, drawing swift reprisals from European farmers, but Monsanto President Brett Begemann says on the company's 4Q conference call that ""we remain optimistic,"" and that Monsanto anticipates glyphosate-- he world's most widely used herbicide--to be re-registered by the end of 2017.

1021 ET - While 85-90% of coffee export revenues go to Brazilian coffee growers, they receive only 10% of the overall industry profits, says the Programa Brasil da Plataforma Global do Cafe's Pedro Ronca at the Global Coffee Sustainability Conference in Geneva. By engaging the research establishment, exporters like Cecafe, and big agro-chemical companies like Syngenta , Bayer , and Dow Agroscience, the Brazilian coffee sector can move closer to the Global Coffee Platform target of 80% of production coming from small and medium-sized farms. Between 20% and 30% of the Brazilian coffee market currently follows sustainability guidelines, Mr. Ronca estimates. On a global level, ""there is a long way to go,"" he says. ""It takes time to build trust and relationships and understand mutual interests, but I still believe that co-operation is the best way to go forward,"" he adds.

""A degree of volatility is normal in the first days,"" Mr. Allegri says. ""Moreover, the company returned to trading on a difficult day for the markets.""

0942 ET - Monsanto outlines some additional defensive steps the crop seed and chemical maker is taking as it rolls out new biotech soybeans paired with a powerful herbicide, dicamba, which has been blamed for damaging more than 3M acres of crops over the summer. Monsanto has maintained that if farmers follow the instructions for spraying dicamba, it can be prevented from drifting onto nearby fields, and as the company projects acreage of the new biotech seeds to double next year, it will provide ""enhanced training"" to farmers and give out specialized spray nozzles for free. Monsanto also upping its incentive for farmers to use its new version of the spray--which Monsanto maintains is more reliable than other versions. (jacob.bunge@wsj.com; @jacobbunge)

0939 ET - Wells Fargo says it's refunding certain customers who may have wrongfully paid fees for mortgage lock extensions. The bank gave additional details after its CEO Timothy Sloan mentioned the refunds during a Congressional hearing Tuesday. The bank says it will reach out to all home lending customers who paid fees for so-called mortgage rate lock extensions from September 16, 2013 through February 28, 2017, around 110,000, and refund customers who believe they shouldn't have paid those fees. The bank says it found its policy implemented in September 2013 wasn't always consistent and sometimes customers were charged fees when the bank was responsible for delays that necessitated extensions. Wells Fargo changed its policy in March 2017. Over the summer the bank disclosed that it was reviewing policies and procedures around mortgage rate lock extension fees following media reports and that the CFPB was investigating the matter.

BELLEVUE, Wash., Oct. 5, 2017

BELLEVUE, Wash., Oct. 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- October is Plan a Cruise Month, prime time for sea veterans and newcomers alike to start planning a cruise vacation. 25.3 million(1) people are expected to take a cruise by the end of 2017, a number that has steadily grown over the past few years. With trips on top cruise lines including Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian bookable up to 18 months in advance, Expedia.com (R) makes comparing cruise lines and finding a great deal easy. To help travelers find and book the perfect cruise getaway, the experts at Expedia(R) CruiseShipCenters(R) have compiled insights on the latest cruise crazes and how to save on your next trip.

""With cruises you get the complete vacation experience and you can relax knowing that everything has been taken care of, from your food and accommodations to your entertainment and transportation,"" says Matthew Eichhorst, VP, Global Cruise, Expedia, Inc . ""Travelers can easily book their cruise online at Expedia.com, or they can visit one of our Expedia CruiseShipCenters locations to speak with our knowledgeable Travel Consultants who can help them plan the vacation of their dreams.""

Cruising Trends and Growth

Cruises are gaining popularity, and more than 100 million people are expected to take a cruise in the next four years.(2) In fact, cruises enjoy the highest satisfaction rate of any vacation, and 84 percent of cruisers would recommend cruising to a friend.(3) And despite misconceptions and anxiety about cruise expenses(4) , included amenities like meals, activities, and room service can make voyages much more cost-effective than land-based vacations. Plus, travelers can visit multiple destinations without extra transportation costs. As cruise lines look to continue to shake up assumptions of what a cruise can be, here are some industry trends making major waves: 


   -- New ships on the block. Over 100 new cruise ships will debut in the next 
      decade, and 26 new ocean, river and specialty cruise ships are expected 
      to debut in 2017 alone. 
 
   -- All-time favorites meet new frontiers. According to a recent survey5, the 
      most in-demand cruises continue to be ever-popular routes to the 
      Caribbean and Alaska. However, expedition cruises are also growing in 
      popularity as more cruise lines are offering itineraries to the Galapagos 
      Islands and remote polar regions. 
 
   -- New Panama Canal. Another key catalyst driving the cruise industry's 
      growth is the widening of the Panama Canal. The nine-year canal expansion 
      project will enable bigger cargo ships and many of the world's biggest 
      cruise ships to pass through, cutting off the extra 8,000 miles it would 
      take to sail around Cape Horn. 
 
   -- Nearly 20 percent of millennials plan to take a cruise in the next 12 
      months.6 Many cruise lines are wooing millennial travelers with high-tech 
      amenities, fun onboard activities (ziplines, mixology classes, skydiving 
      simulators) and late-night dance parties with international DJs. Carnival 
      Cruise Line's Carnival Vista even has its own brewery. 
 
   -- Private beach attractions are gaining popularity. Cruise lines are 
      investing more in exclusive ownership of private islands to enhance the 
      guest experience. These islands -- like Royal Caribbean 's CocoCay -- are 
      equipped with luxury amenities, bars, easier accessibility, acres of 
      lounge chairs, and beach pavilions. 
 
   -- Sea foodies. Survey respondents ranked cruises for foodies and gourmands 
      as the most popular themed cruise type7, and there is no shortage of 
      delectable options to explore. Norwegian Cruise Line  has their ""Meet the 
      Winemaker Cruises,"" which allows passengers the opportunity to wine and 
      dine with leaders and legends of the wine making industry. Last year 
      Holland America partnered with America's Test Kitchen to bring live 
      onboard cooking shows and hands-on workshops on select ships. 
 
   -- Celebrity performances. Cruise lines continue to draw celebrities to 
      perform on their ships, with past headliners including Demi Lovato, 
      Bonnie Tyler, and Carrie Underwood. It's been two years since their last 
      cruise, but next year Backstreet's back! The Backstreet Boys Cruise with 
      Carnival Cruise Lines  sails from Miami to Grand Turk May 3-7, 2018. 
 
   -- Luxury cruises are going all out. The world's finest cruises allow 
      travelers to experience first-class amenities and other extravagances 
      like infinity pools, underwater lounges and helicopters. 

6 Ways to Save On Your Next Cruise Vacation

For travelers looking to get a great price on their next sea voyage, Expedia has a few money-saving tips to keep in mind: 


   -- Book your cruise through a travel agent -- like Expedia  
      CruiseShipCenters . Travel agents can negotiate contracted rates directly 
      with cruise lines so they can save travelers on average $452 per trip.8 
 
   -- When planning a cruise vacation, book early. Often, cruise lines will 
      offer early booking incentives in the form of low fares, value add-ons 
      and upgrades if you book months in advance, typically six -- 18 months 
      out. 
 
   -- If you have a few friends or family members who want to go on a cruise, 
      take advantage of group booking discounts. In general, if you book as a 
      large group with most cruise lines, one person will often cruise for 
      free. Fun fact: Expedia CruiseShipCenters  has a Group Program that allows 
      travelers to take advantage of the group booking price without needing to 
      be part of a group. This is something that isn't offered if you were to 
      book directly with the cruise line. 
 
   -- Consider taking a cruise during the off-season or shoulder season when 
      people are no longer taking vacation to net big savings. There can also 
      be a tremendous price difference between one week and the next, so 
      consider alternative weeks to reduce the price of your cruise fare. It 
      pays to be flexible! 
 
   -- Arrange your own shore excursions instead of booking them through the 
      cruise line. Cruise lines offer shore excursions for their passengers but 
      paying for the convenience is pricey. Book your shore activities on 
      Expedia  to save money. 
 
   -- There are many options for finding cruise deals on Expedia  and there are 
      new deals every day. Now through October 31 travelers can get up to $150 
      to spend onboard 2017 Holland America Line  Caribbean cruises. Check out 
      the Expedia Deals page for more last-minute cruise offers.

COST reports sales figures monthly so those numbers are known and look strong, but AMZN's purchase of Whole Foods this summer could pose a direct threat to COST's generally higher income shopper base.

1233 ET - Global student housing investment inflows have reached record highs in 2016, according to Savills , with volumes going up to $16.45 billion. That's mainly because the asset class provides higher yields at times when commercial real estate yields globally are at their lowest ever. But, student housing ""yields may harden as institutional involvement increases, the sector matures and perceived risk diminishes,"" the real estate advisor says. France and Germany benefited from the highest increase.

PALO ALTO, Calif., Oct. 12, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HP (NYSE:HPQ) --","News highlights: 


   -- Estimates GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations 
      for fiscal 2018 of $1.69 to $1.79 
 
   -- Estimates non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2018 of 
      $1.74 to $1.84 
 
   -- Estimates fiscal 2018 free cash flow of at least $3.0 billion 
 
   -- Expects to return 50%-75% of fiscal 2018 free cash flow to shareholders 
      through dividends and share repurchases 

Today at HP Inc .'s 2017 Securities Analyst Meeting (SAM), the company provided details on its strategy and opportunities for long-term growth, coupled with its financial outlook for fiscal 2018.

""Fiscal 2017 has been a tremendous year for HP and we are just getting started. We've delivered reliable earnings and cash flow, taken profitable share, driven productivity, stabilized our core businesses, and importantly, we grew,"" said Dion Weisler , President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc. ""We are well positioned to lead in the core, accelerate growth opportunities, like A3 and Graphics in Printing and commercial transformation in Personal Systems, and capture the future with 3D Printing in plastics and now metals.""

Fiscal 2018 outlook

For fiscal 2018, the company estimates GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.69 to $1.79 and estimates non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $1.74 to $1.84. Fiscal 2018 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share estimates exclude after-tax costs primarily related to items such as restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related charges, defined benefit plan settlement charges, amortization of intangible assets, non-operating retirement-related credits/(charges), net tax indemnifications, net valuation allowances and discontinued operations. Based on the current environment, HP anticipates generating free cash flow of at least $3.0 billion for fiscal 2018.

HP expects to return 50%-75% of annual free cash flow to shareholders. In fiscal 2018, the company indicated that it expects to be towards the higher end of that range, with a 5% increase in the planned quarterly dividend amount, and the balance returned to shareholders through share repurchases.

""HP has been building strong business momentum, demonstrating our strategy is working,"" said Cathie Lesjak, Chief Financial Officer. ""We expect to continue our momentum in fiscal 2018. We have shown that we can deliver in the short-term, while also positioning ourselves for long-term success.""

Forward-looking statements

Today's presentations contain forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If the risks or uncertainties ever materialize or the assumptions prove incorrect, the results of HP Inc . and its consolidated subsidiaries (""HP "") may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements and assumptions.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including but not limited to any projections of net revenue, margins, expenses, effective tax rates, net earnings, net earnings per share, cash flows, benefit plan funding, deferred taxes, share repurchases, foreign currency exchange rates or other financial items; any projections of the amount, timing or impact of cost savings or restructuring and other charges; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations, including the execution of restructuring plans and any resulting cost savings, net revenue or profitability improvements; any statements concerning the expected development, performance, market share or competitive performance relating to products or services; any statements regarding current or future macroeconomic trends or events and the impact of those trends and events on HP and its financial performance; any statements regarding pending investigations, claims or disputes; any statements of expectation or belief, including with respect to the timing and expected benefits of acquisitions and other business combinations and investment transactions; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing.

Risks, uncertainties and assumptions include the need to address the many challenges facing HP 's businesses; the competitive pressures faced by HP 's businesses; risks associated with executing HP 's strategy; the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical trends and events; the need to manage third-party suppliers and the distribution of HP 's products and the delivery of HP 's services effectively; the protection of HP 's intellectual property assets, including intellectual property licensed from third parties; risks associated with HP 's international operations; the development and transition of new products and services and the enhancement of existing products and services to meet customer needs and respond to emerging technological trends; the execution and performance of contracts by HP and its suppliers, customers, clients and partners; the hiring and retention of key employees; integration and other risks associated with business combination and investment transactions; the results of the restructuring plans, including estimates and assumptions related to the cost (including any possible disruption of HP 's business) and the anticipated benefits of the restructuring plans; the resolution of pending investigations, claims and disputes; and other risks that are described in HP 's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 and HP 's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission .

As in prior periods, the financial information set forth in today's presentations, including any tax-related items, reflects estimates based on information available at this time. While HP believes these estimates to be reasonable, these amounts could differ materially from reported amounts in HP 's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ending October 31, 2017 and October 31, 2018. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update these forward-looking statements. HP 's Investor Relations website at http://www.hp.com/investor/home  contains a significant amount of information about HP , including financial and other information for investors. HP encourages investors to visit its website from time to time, as information is updated and new information is posted.

Use of non-GAAP financial information

To supplement HP 's consolidated financial statements presented on a generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") basis, HP provides net revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP total operating expense, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, free cash flow, gross cash and net cash (debt) financial measures. HP also provides forecasts of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share. These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the slides presented at the 2017 Securities Analyst Meeting. In addition, an explanation of the ways in which HP 's management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate its business, the substance behind HP 's decision to use these non-GAAP measures, the material limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP measures, the manner in which HP 's management compensates for those limitations, and the substantive reasons why HP 's management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors is included below. This additional non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net revenue, operating profit from continuing operations, operating margin from continuing operations, net earnings from continuing operations, diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations or cash and cash equivalents prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Use and economic substance of non-GAAP financial measures

Net revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change in the foreign currency exchange rate from the prior-year period. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined to exclude the effects of any amounts relating to restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related charges, defined benefit plan settlement charges, amortization of intangible assets and non-operating retirement-related credits/(charges). Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net EPS consist of net earnings from continuing operations or diluted net EPS from continuing operations excluding those same charges and net tax indemnifications. In addition, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net EPS are adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each non-GAAP item and other tax benefits or charges as a consequence of the separation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company from HP Inc . (the ""Separation""). HP 's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of evaluating HP 's historical and prospective financial performance, as well as HP 's performance relative to its competitors. HP 's management also uses these non-GAAP measures to further its

12 Oct 2017 19:45 ET 
Press Release: HP Inc . Announces Fiscal 2018 -2-

own understanding of HP 's segment operating performance. HP believes that excluding the items mentioned above for these non-GAAP financial measures allows HP 's management to better understand HP 's consolidated financial performance in relation to the operating results of HP 's segments, as HP 's management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results. More specifically, HP 's management excludes each of those items mentioned above for the following reasons: 


   -- Restructuring and other charges are (i) costs associated with a formal 
      restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee termination 
      costs and benefits, costs of real estate consolidation and other 
      non-labor charges; and (ii) other charges, which include non-recurring 
      costs that are distinct from ongoing operational costs. HP  excludes these 
      restructuring and other charges (and any reversals of charges recorded in 
      prior periods) for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures 
      because HP  believes that these historical costs do not reflect expected 
      future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful 
      evaluation of HP 's current operating performance or comparisons to HP 's 
      operating performance in other periods. 
 
   -- HP  incurs cost related to its acquisitions, which it would not have 
      otherwise incurred as part of its operations. The charges are direct 
      expenses such as third-party professional and legal fees, and 
      integration-related costs. These charges related to acquisitions are 
      inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by 
      the timing and nature of HP 's acquisitions. HP  believes that eliminating 
      such expenses for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures 
      facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of HP 's current operating 
      performance and comparisons to HP 's past operating performance. 
 
   -- HP  incurs charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets. 
      Those charges are included in HP 's GAAP earnings from continuing 
      operations, operating margin from continuing operations, net earnings 
      from continuing operations and diluted net EPS from continuing 
      operations. Such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and 
      magnitude of HP 's acquisitions and any related impairment charges. 
      Consequently, HP  excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these 
      non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of HP 's 
      current operating performance and comparisons to HP 's operating 
      performance in other periods. 
 
   -- Non-operating retirement-related credits/(charges) includes certain 
      market-related factors such as interest cost, expected return on plan 
      assets, amortized actuarial gains or losses, and impacts from other 
      market-related factors associated with HP 's defined benefit pension and 
      post-retirement benefit plans. The market-driven retirement-related 
      adjustments are primarily due to the changes in pension plan assets and 
      liabilities which are tied to financial market performance and HP  
      considers these adjustments to be outside the operational performance of 
      the business. Non-operating retirement-related credits/(charges) also 
      include certain plan curtailments, settlements and special termination 
      benefits related to HP 's defined benefit pension and post-retirement 
      benefit plans. HP  believes that eliminating such adjustments for purposes 
      of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation 
      of HP 's current operating performance and provides better transparency 
      into the segment operating results. 
 
   -- As part of the Separation, HP  evaluates all tax uncertain positions to 
      determine the indemnification amounts under the Tax Matters Agreement 
      with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company  and records the adjustments as 
      net tax indemnifications amounts for the quarter. HP  excludes these 
      adjustments for the purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to 
      facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of HP 's current operating 
      performance and comparisons to HP 's operating performance in other 
      periods. 
 
   -- HP  incurred defined benefit plan settlement charges relating to the U.S. 
      HP  pension plan. The charges are associated with the net settlement and 
      remeasurement resulting from voluntary lump sum payments offered to 
      certain terminated vested participants. HP  excludes these charges for the 
      purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more 
      meaningful evaluation of HP 's current operating performance and 
      comparisons to HP 's operating performance in other periods. 
 
   -- As part of the Separation, HP  recorded several Separation-related items 
      including: the reversal of a previously recorded valuation allowance, the 
      write-off of specific deferred taxes providing no continued benefit to HP  
      and the entry of certain Separation-related deferred tax expense.  HP  
      believes that eliminating these amounts for purposes of calculating 
      non-GAAP net earnings facilitates a more meaningful comparison of HP 's 
      net earnings to other periods, as HP 's management does not believe that 
      the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results. 

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as cash flow from operations less net capital expenditures. Net capital expenditures is defined as investments in property, plant and equipment less proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. Gross cash is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments and certain long-term investments that may be liquidated within 90 days pursuant to the terms of existing put options or similar rights. HP 's management uses gross cash for the purpose of determining the amount of cash available for investment in HP 's businesses, repurchasing stock and other purposes. HP 's management also uses gross cash to evaluate HP 's historical and prospective liquidity. Because gross cash includes liquid assets that are not included in GAAP cash and cash equivalents, HP believes that gross cash provides a helpful assessment of HP 's liquidity. Net cash (debt) is defined as gross cash less gross debt after adjusting the effect of unamortized premium/discount on debt issuance, debt issuance costs and unrealized gains/losses on fair value hedges and interest rate swaps.

Material limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measures

These non-GAAP financial measures may have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of HP 's results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations in relying on these non-GAAP financial measures are: 


   -- Items such as amortization of intangible assets, though not directly 
      affecting HP 's cash position, represent the loss in value of intangible 
      assets over time. The expense associated with this change in value is not 
      included in non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP 
      diluted net EPS, and therefore does not reflect the full economic effect 
      of the change in value of those intangible assets. 
 
   -- Items such as restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related 
      charges, non-operating retirement-related credits/(charges), defined 
      benefit plan settlement charges, net tax indemnifications and net 
      valuation allowance, and separation taxes and adjustments that are 
      excluded from non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net earnings and 
      non-GAAP diluted net EPS can have a material impact on the equivalent 
      GAAP earnings measure and cash flows. 
 
   -- HP  may not be able to immediately liquidate the short-term and long-term 
      investments included in gross cash, which may limit the usefulness of 
      gross cash as a liquidity measure. 
 
   -- Other companies may calculate the non-GAAP financial measures differently 
      than HP , limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative 
      purposes. 

Compensation for limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measures

HP compensates for the limitations on its use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally. HP also provides robust and detailed reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure within this news release and in other written materials that include these non-GAAP financial measures, and HP encourages investors to review those reconciliations carefully.

Usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures to investors

HP believes that providing net revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP total operating expense, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net EPS, free cash flow, gross cash and net cash (debt) to investors in addition to the related GAAP financial measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by HP 's management in its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see HP 's results ""through the eyes"" of management. HP further believes that providing this information better enables HP 's investors to understand HP 's operating performance and financial condition and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by HP 's management to evaluate and measure such performance and financial condition. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates comparisons of HP 's operating performance with the performance of other companies in HP 's industry that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated in a similar manner.

2017-10-12,HIG,Press Release: The Hartford Pledges Support For Home Fire Prevention And Safety Programs In Montgomery,"The Hartford Pledges Support For Home Fire Prevention And Safety Programs In Montgomery 


   -- A home fire is reported in the United States every 86 seconds and 33 
      percent of home fires are started by children 6-9 years old1 
 
   -- The Hartford brings Junior Fire Marshal(R) program to Montgomery and will 
      donate a total of $20,000 to the school district and fire department for 
      fire safety education 
HARTFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 12, 2017-- ","The Hartford is providing funding and educational resources for fire prevention and safety education to Montgomery, Ala. and the other cities in The Hartford's Home Fire Index. According to the Index, Montgomery is No. 25 among the 100 U.S. cities with the highest home fire risk. The Index is based on an analysis of the U.S. Fire Administration 's National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS)(2) and a survey conducted by The Hartford on fire safety and prevention behaviors among the general population.

As part of the 70th anniversary of The Hartford's Junior Fire Marshal program, which is one of the country's oldest corporate-sponsored public education programs, The Hartford is donating a total of $20,000 to the Montgomery public school district and fire department for fire safety education. The donation is part of a larger commitment the company made to all the cities on The Hartford's Home Fire Index.

In addition, to the monetary donation, The Hartford will also distribute Junior Fire Marshal educational materials to children in kindergarten through third grade in the Montgomery public school district. The Hartford Junior Fire Marshal classroom kit comes with The Hartford's signature red fire helmets, an educator and parent guide and coloring posters designed to introduce fire safety concepts to children.

""The Junior Fire Marshal program is part of The Hartford's ongoing commitment to help build safer communities,"" said Debora Raymond, spokesperson for The Hartford's Junior Fire Marshal program. ""We are pleased to be able to bring this program to the city of Montgomery and empower the next generation of children to take an active role in reducing the fire risk in their homes.""

Many Montgomery residents engage in behaviors that can increase the risk of a home fire according to The Hartford survey. Charging a phone overnight is considered moderate risk, yet charging a phone overnight on your bed, leaving your kitchen with the stove on, or leaving a room with a candle burning are considered high risk. The survey found: 


   -- 56 percent admitted they had charged a device (e.g., cell phone, tablet, 
      laptop) in or on their bed overnight in the past year -- compared with 34 
      percent nationally, 
 
   -- 60 percent said that in the past year, they have left the kitchen while 
      cooking something on a stove -- compared with 58 percent nationally 
 
   -- 49 percent revealed that they have left a room with a candle lit at least 
      once over the past year -- compared with 37 percent nationally. 

The History of the Junior Fire Marshal Program

The Junior Fire Marshal program was started in 1947 by an employee of The Hartford. Since the program's inception, The Hartford has deputized more than 110 million Junior Fire Marshals.

The company's signature red fire helmets have been displayed proudly by generations of children who have learned the basics of fire safety through this innovative and educational program. The program teaches lifesaving lessons such as Stop, Drop and Roll, Go Low in Smoke and Draw a Home Fire Escape Plan. These lessons, along with other fun, engaging and educational activities, help parents and teachers have meaningful and vital fire safety conversations with children and students.

Over the years, celebrities such as Ron Howard, Dick Van Dyke, Jack Benny, Jimmy Dean, Mr. Green Jeans and Captain Kangaroo, Carol Channing, Red Skelton, Johnny Carson, Robert Young, Henry ""the Fonz"" Winkler and Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan have helped The Hartford recognize children who participated in the Junior Fire Marshal program.

(1) According to the National Fire Protection Association

(2) NFIRS is a voluntary reporting system run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency based on data submitted by fire departments from around the country. The data was standardized based on population size and adjusted as needed to reflect the voluntary nature of the data within the system.

About The Hartford Home Fire Index

The Hartford Home Fire Index is based on a study of the largest U.S. cities with a minimum of 80,000 housing units as reported by the 2010 U.S. Census. The Hartford calculated a rate of residential fires using the number of residential structure fires from the 2014 National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) data, dividing by 2010 U.S. Census housing units. The Hartford also conducted a survey on fire safety and prevention behaviors among the general population in late 2016 and in early 2017. Survey respondents (approximately 100 per city) were given a score based on adoption of fire safety best practices. Standardized fire rates and survey scores were averaged to produce a composite score for each city.

Rents on the Rise","After Hurricanes

Average self-storage rents increased 0.9% in the third quarter from the same period a year earlier, partly because of stronger demand from areas affected recently by hurricanes, according to data from research firm Green Street Advisors.

""It is safe to assume that occupancies in hurricane-impacted markets, although difficult to measure with precision, are now nicely higher,"" said Green Street.

The boost in demand managed to offset somewhat the impact of a boom in construction activity that has weighed on rents in many markets across the country, especially in Houston before Hurricane Harvey.

CubeSmart recorded average rent growth of 2.3% in the quarter. Rents in Extra Space Storage Inc. and Public Storage rose an average of 0.2% and 1.3%, respectively.

Average rents at Life Storage Inc. fell 1.5%. Life Storage earlier said it would keep its rate and leasing incentives unchanged in Houston and Florida and added that it already had a strong occupancy rate of about 92% in Houston before Harvey.

According to SpareFoot.com, a marketplace for storage facilities across the country, there had been a spike in demand for new rentals after the recent hurricanes in affected areas but it has now petered out.

Customers in storm-battered areas are likely to keep their boxes for a longer time than they initially anticipate, said Chuck Gordon, chief executive officer of SpareFoot. That would benefit places like Houston for the long term, but not enough to warrant more development projects.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Website for Pop-Ups

Secures Funding

A venture-capital firm that focuses on real-estate technology is investing in a London startup that has created an online marketplace for pop-up stores.

Fifth Wall Ventures, which is backed by big names in the real-estate world like Hines, CBRE Group Inc. and Macerich Co., has made a significant investment in Appear Here, said Brendan Wallace, Fifth Wall's managing partner. He declined to specify an amount or how much of a stake Fifth Wall is taking.

Founded in 2013, Appear Here has hooked up thousands of retailers with landlords in London and other U.K. cities. Its website includes more than 100,000 brands looking for space. The company, which enables retailers to sign leases for days or months, also has expanded to Paris and New York.

Pop-up stores selling seasonal goods like Halloween costumes have existed for years. But numerous online marketplaces have been launched to make it easier for tenants and landlords to find each other.

""We've standardized the process, which used to take six months, and made it take 48 hours,"" said Ross Bailey, Appear Here's founder and CEO.

1528 ET - Despite President Maduro's low popularity and Venezuela's crippling economic crisis, it's the leader's detractors who appear to be more fractured than ever as they reel from their loss in recent state governor elections. The opposition's most prominent leader, Henrique Capriles , says he will no longer be a part of the opposition coalition until the Democratic Action Party, one of the alliance's biggest members, pulls out. Democratic Action is under fire and faces accusations of kowtowing to the authoritarian government after four of their governors on Monday agreed to take oath of office by submitting their authority to the pro-Maduro legislative superbody. Democratic Action chief Henry Ramos says his party has betrayed no one, but Capriles is adamant that there is no way forward together. ""What happened yesterday has no justification,"" Capriles says.

1436 ET - AbbVie is betting big on a new approach to combating Alzheimer's disease from biotechnology company Alector. AbbVie is paying $205M up front to the startup through a collaboration to develop treatments for the neurological disease, which affects 5.5 million Americans. Alzheimer's has been a graveyard for drugmakers. Last month Axovant Sciences saw a therapy that promotes release of the brain chemical acetylcholine fail in late-stage clinical trials. Instead of targeting specific disease mechanisms, Alector develops drugs that awaken the immune system in the brain so it can carry out functions that stop the progression of Alzheimer's. AbbVie is also developing a different type of Alzheimer's drug that targets the protein tau. (brian.gormley@wsj.com)

1419 ET - The SEC will intervene to protect US brokers from the biggest consequences of a European law that overhauls how investors pay for Wall Street research. The SEC's chairman, Jay Clayton , tells an industry conference that the SEC's relief should be ""satisfactory"" to Wall Street. Under the European law, known as Mifid II [Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II], investors are required to pay separately for research rather than funding it through trade commissions. Without SEC intervention, US broker-dealers could face stricter regulation of analyst research when they sell it separately to European funds, because the reports could be deemed to be investment advice. The SEC is working with European regulators to craft the relief so it doesn't impede Europe's goals for more transparency but also protects the way business is done in the US, Clayton says.

ATLANTA, Oct. 24, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PulteGroup, Inc . (NYSE:PHM) announced today financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2017. For the quarter, the Company's reported net income was $178 million, or $0.58 per share. Adjusted net income for the period was $181 million, or $0.60 per share, after excluding a pretax charge of $5 million resulting from the resolution of certain insurance matters.

Reported net income for the prior year third quarter was $128 million, or $0.37 per share. Adjusted net income for the period was $148 million, or $0.43 per share, after excluding costs associated with the settlement of a disputed land transaction, certain restructuring costs and costs relating to shareholder activities.

""We continue to be extremely pleased with the strength of homebuyer demand and the sustained course of the housing recovery,"" said Ryan Marshall , President and CEO of PulteGroup. ""Despite the disruptions caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, our 11% increase in year-over-year orders for the quarter points to the health of the market, while the 15% increase in our backlog puts us in an excellent position to deliver strong fourth quarter and full-year financial results.""

""Fueled by growing demand among first-time buyers and supported by a strong economy, high employment, and historically low interest rates, U.S. new home sales for 2017 are expected to grow a healthy 5% to 10% over last year,"" added Marshall. ""We remain optimistic about the strength of future housing demand, as the current housing cycle moves into its seventh year of growth.""

Third Quarter Results

Home sale revenues for the third quarter increased 9% over the prior year to $2.1 billion. Higher revenues for the period were driven by a 2% increase in deliveries to 5,151 homes, combined with a 7%, or $25,000, increase in average sales price to $399,000.

Home sale gross margin for the third quarter was 23.9%, which is down 80 basis points from the prior year, but is up 50 basis points from the Company's second quarter 2017 adjusted gross margin of 23.4%. Homebuilding SG&A expense for the quarter of $237 million, or 11.6% of home sale revenues, included a $5 million charge associated with the resolution of certain insurance matters. Prior year SG&A of $251 million, or 13.3% of home sale revenues, included approximately $12 million of charges for certain restructuring costs and shareholder activities.

Net new orders for the third quarter increased 11% to 5,300 homes, while the value of new orders increased 23% over the prior year to $2.3 billion. The Company operated out of 778 communities for the third quarter, which is up 10% over the third quarter of 2016.

Ending backlog for the quarter was up 15% over the prior year to 10,823 homes, as backlog value gained 26% to $4.7 billion. The average price of homes in backlog increased 10% over the prior year to $431,000, which is a 10 year high for the Company.

The Company's financial services operations reported third quarter pretax income of $18 million compared with $21 million in 2016. The decrease in pretax income for the period was primarily the result of a more competitive operating environment which impacted pricing during the period. Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 80%, compared with 81% in the prior year.

During the quarter, the Company repurchased 10.4 million common shares for $260 million, or an average price of $25.11 per share.

A conference call discussing PulteGroup 's third quarter 2017 results is scheduled for Tuesday, October 24, 2017, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Interested investors can access the live webcast via PulteGroup 's corporate website at www.pultegroupinc.com.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

24 Oct 2017 06:30 ET 
Press Release: PulteGroup   Reports Third Quarter -3-

This report contains information about our operating results reflecting certain adjustments, including adjustments to cost of revenues, selling general, and administrative expenses, income before income taxes, income tax expense, net income, diluted earnings per share, and operating margin. These measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under the SEC's rules and should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP financial measures as measures of our profitability. We believe that reflecting these adjustments provides investors relevant and useful information for evaluating the comparability of financial information presented and comparing our profitability to other companies in the homebuilding industry. Although other companies in the homebuilding industry report similar information, the methods used may differ. We urge investors to understand the methods used by other companies in the homebuilding industry to calculate these measures and any adjustments thereto before comparing our measures to those of such other companies.

The following tables set forth a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures that management believes to be most directly comparable ($000's omitted):

Press Release: Fitch Affirms Xylem's IDR at 'BBB'; Outlook Stable


 
 
The following is a press release from Fitch Ratings : 
 ","Fitch Ratings-New York-06 October 2017: Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for Xylem at 'BBB' and the Short-Term IDR at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The ratings apply to approximately $2.4 billion in total debt. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of the release.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Fitch expects the company to generate roughly $4.7 billion in revenue for full-year 2017, which would be a 25% increase from prior year, largely driven by the Sensus acquisition. On a pro forma basis, Fitch expects organic revenue to grow by 3% to 4% annually. Fitch notes that the company's Water Infrastructure segment no longer includes the results of the Analytics business on a stand-alone basis, as it is not combined with Sensus and Visenti segments effective second quarter 2017 (2Q17).

In 2Q17, the company experienced an 8% increase in orders with double-digit growth in treatment orders which typically signals strength in the water utility sector. The company generated 16.6% EBITDA margins through June 30, 2017 up from 16% for fiscal year (FY) 2016. Fitch expects margins to gradually expand as the company continues to successfully integrate the Sensus acquisition and rise above 17% in the medium term. Fitch expects much of the margin enhancement to come from revenue synergies generated by recent acquisitions in addition to scalable organic revenue across all segments.

XYL experienced 2% organic growth in the Sensus & Analytics segment over prior year through 2Q17 driven by strength in smart electric, smart gas and Saas verticals. The segment has seen particularly strong performance with the Sensus Stratus electric meter which helps electric utilities and municipalities better balance supply and demand and restore service faster following outages. On a consolidated basis, organic growth through 2Q17 was largely powered by the residential end market as it gained 15% over the prior year, followed by the commercial and industrial end markets which contributed 3% and 2% of organic growth respectively. Alternatively, the public utility end market saw 4% organic decline during the same period. Geographically, the vast majority of organic growth was powered by E.M. which saw 7% growth over the prior year compared to a flat U.S. region and a 3% decline in Western Europe.

Fitch expects XYL's debt/EBITDA for year-end 2017 to fall to roughly 3.0x as the company continues to de-lever following the Sensus acquisition. This compares to a debt/EBITDA level of 4.0x and 3.5x as of Dec. 31, 2016 and June 30, 2017 respectively. Fitch further expects the company's total adjusted debt/EBITDAR for FY2017 to be roughly 3.3x falling to 2.8x by FY2019 driven by expanding margins. XYL's funds from operations (FFO) adjusted leverage as of June 30, 2017 was 4.5x, down from 5.1x as of Dec. 31, 2016. Fitch expects the company's FFO adjusted leverage to be roughly 3.8x for FY2017 and 3.3x by FY2019. Fitch further expects the company to grow free cash flow (FCF) toward its recent historic levels. Fitch expects the company to generate approximately $250 million in (post-dividend) FCF for FY2017 or a roughly 5% FCF margin. This compares to the 6.7% and 6.9% FCF margins generated in FY2015 and FY2016 respectively, with the decline largely driven by working capital needs. Fitch further expects the company's FCF margin to rebound toward 6% or 7% in the medium term.

Fitch remains concerned with XYL's currency risk given that through June 30, 2017, the company generated roughly 54% of its revenue from non-U.S. operations, which is down from 59% for the same period prior year, largely driven by the Sensus acquisition. The company's exposure to currency risk is somewhat offset by its EUR500 million notes which mature in March of 2023. This risk is further mitigated by XYL's limited exposure to the most volatile currencies in the world today. Xylem's combined exposure to the Middle East, Africa and Latin America is roughly 10% of revenue. Further, XYL hedges up to 75% of its net primary foreign currency transactional exposure with its annual hedging program.

XYL's net pension obligation was approximately $854 million (66% funded) as of December 2016. The domestic post-retirement benefit obligation (PBO) totalled only $100 million whereas the international plan represents the lion's share with $754 million in obligations. The company's domestic plan is 69% funded and has been closed to new employees since 2011. XYL contributed $27 million and $25 million to pension and retirement benefits in 2016 and 2015 respectively. Contributions for 2017 are expected to be approximately $30 million and totalled $13 million through the first six months of 2017 compared to $14 million during the same period in 2016. Fitch believes that the pension obligations are manageable due to the company's solid FCF generation.

Fitch expects XYL to rely on internally generated cash to fund its balanced cash deployment strategy in 2017 and beyond. The firm's strategy will be focused on capital expenditures and bolt-on acquisitions. Fitch notes that the company's R&D as a portion of revenue has climbed following the Sensus acquisition to 3.8% of revenue YTD, which is up from 2.9% for FY2016. Fitch expects R&D to remain in the high 3% range in the medium term, with the potential to rise incrementally depending on future acquisitions. Fitch expects the company to prioritize accretive acquisitions over share repurchases, though a return to pre-Sensus repurchases levels (which peaked at $158 million in 2015) in the absence of any sizable acquisitions would be within Fitch's Base Case scenario. As of June 30, 2017, the company retains $413 million in authorization under its share repurchase program.

DERIVATION SUMMARY

Fitch considers XYL's overall enterprise risk level to be relatively low, as its credit profile is stronger than its diversified industrial peers, reflecting a combination of Xylem's size, market position and conservative financial policies. Significant aftermarket and replacement equipment content, which accounts for nearly 40% of revenue, further underpins its credit profile. Peers such as Flowserve , ITT and IDEX are all well capitalized and have global scale, making them strong competitors, however XYL's low margin volatility and consistent FCF generation allows it an incremental measure financial flexibility.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include:

--Limited future negative impacts from currency fluctuations;

--Consolidated EBITDA margins of at least 16% through the medium term;

--Moderate annual increases in the size of the dividend;

--Capex of roughly 3.2% of revenue through the medium term;

--R&D of roughly 3.8% of revenue through the medium term.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action

--An increase in adjusted debt/EBITDAR above 3.0x on a sustained basis;

--An increase in FFO adjusted leverage above 3.50x on a sustained basis;

--FCF margin below 1.5% for a prolonged period;

--Debt-funded acquisition or shareholder-friendly activity.

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action

--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR below 2.0x for a sustained period;

--FCF margins above 7% for a prolonged period.

LIQUIDITY

Fitch expects XYL's financial flexibility to remain adequate to meet its obligations over the medium term supported by adequate liquidity. The company's aggregate liquidity stands at approximately $789 million at 2Q17 comprised of $288 million (Fitch notes that $270 million was held internationally) of cash and equivalents and roughly $501 million of availability under its senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The company utilizes its commercial paper program as a means of short-term funding as it has a combined outstanding limit of $600 million inclusive of its revolving credit facility which had $99 million outstanding as of June 30, 2017. The company's credit facility matures in March of 2020.

FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS

Fitch has affirmed XYL's ratings as follows:

--Long-Term IDR at 'BBB';

--Senior unsecured bank facility at 'BBB';

--Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB';

--Short-term IDR at 'F2';

--Commercial paper at 'F2'.

The Rating Outlook is Stable.

The manner of FitchÃ¢ tms factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

     years, and we expect initial stabilized yields of 7.3% and 5.8% (cash 
     basis). 
(2)  Acquisition of the remaining 49% interest in our unconsolidated real 
     estate joint venture with Uber Technologies, Inc . (""Uber"") was completed

     equal installments upon Uber's completion of construction milestones. The 
     first installment of $18.9 million was paid in 2Q17. We expect the second 
     and third installments to be paid in 4Q17 and 1Q18, respectively.

(2)  In May 2017, we completed the sale of a partial interest in our land 
     parcels at 1401/1413 Research Boulevard, located in our Rockville 
     submarket. The sale was executed with a distinguished retail real estate 
     developer for the development of a 90,000 RSF retail shopping center. We 
     contributed the land parcels at a fair value of $7.9 million into a new 
     entity, our partner contributed $3.9 million, and we received a 
     distribution of $0.7 million. In addition, the real estate joint venture 
     obtained a non-recourse secured construction loan with aggregate 
     commitments of $25.0 million, which is expected to fund the remaining 
     construction costs to complete the project, and we do not expect to make 
     additional equity contributions to the real estate joint venture. 
(3)  Represents the sale of a condominium interest for 49% of the building 
     RSF, or 203,090 RSF, in our unconsolidated real estate joint venture 
     property. Net operating income, net operating income (cash basis), and 
     contractual sales price represent our 27.5% share related to the sale of 
     the condominium interest. In August 2017, the unconsolidated real estate 
     joint venture entered into a mortgage loan agreement, secured by the 
     remaining interest in the property. During the nine months ended 
     September 30, 2017, we received a cash distribution of $38.8 million from 
     the joint venture, primarily from the condominium sale and loan 
     refinancing.

About the Company

Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc . (NYSE : ARE), an S&P 500(R) company, is an urban office real estate investment trust (""REIT"") uniquely focused on collaborative life science and technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations, with a total market capitalization of $16.1 billion and an asset base in North America of 28.6 million square feet, as of September 30, 2017. The asset base in North America includes 20.6 million RSF of operating properties, including 1.5 million RSF of development and redevelopment of new Class A properties currently undergoing construction. Additionally, the asset base in North America includes 8.0 million SF of future development projects, including 1.1 million SF of near-term projects undergoing marketing for lease and pre-construction activities and 3.3 million SF of intermediate-term development projects. Founded in 1994, Alexandria pioneered this niche and has since established a significant market presence in key locations, including Greater Boston, San Francisco, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland, and Research Triangle Park. Alexandria has a longstanding and proven track record of developing Class A properties clustered in urban life science and technology campuses that provide its innovative tenants with highly dynamic and collaborative environments that enhance their ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, efficiency, creativity, and success. We believe these advantages result in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value.

AvalonBay Communities, Inc . Announces Third Quarter 2017 Operating Results 


ARLINGTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 30, 2017-- 

AvalonBay Communities, Inc . (NYSE: AVB) (the ""Company"") reported today that Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was $238,248,000. This resulted in a decrease in Earnings per Share -- diluted (""EPS"") of 33.6% to $1.72 for the three months ended September 30, 2017, from $2.59 for the prior year period.

Funds from Operations attributable to common stockholders - diluted (""FFO"") per share for the three months ended September 30, 2017 increased 10.9% to $2.34 from $2.11 for the prior year period.

Core FFO per share (as defined in this release) for the three months ended September 30, 2017 increased 5.8% to $2.19 from $2.07 for the prior year period.

The changes in the Company's EPS, FFO per share and Core FFO per share reflect an increase in Net Operating Income (""NOI"") from existing, acquired and newly developed operating communities for the three months ended September 30, 2017 over the prior year period. The changes in EPS and FFO per share were impacted by the increase in joint venture promoted interest in the current year period. The decrease in EPS was also due to a decrease in gains on sale of real estate and an increase in depreciation.

The following table compares the Company's actual results for EPS, FFO per share and Core FFO per share for the third quarter of 2017 to its August 2017 outlook:

These could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that might cause such differences include the following, among others: we may abandon development or redevelopment opportunities for which we have already incurred costs; adverse capital and credit market conditions may affect our access to various sources of capital and/or cost of capital, which may affect our business activities, earnings and common stock price, among other things; changes in local employment conditions, demand for apartment homes, supply of competitive housing products, and other economic conditions may result in lower than expected occupancy and/or rental rates and adversely affect the profitability of our communities; delays in completing development,

redevelopment and/or lease-up may result in increased financing and construction costs and may delay and/or reduce the profitability of a community; debt and/or equity financing for development, redevelopment or acquisitions of communities may not be available or may not be available on favorable terms; we may be unable to obtain, or experience delays in obtaining, necessary governmental permits and authorizations; expenses may result in communities that we develop or redevelop failing to achieve expected profitability; our assumptions concerning risks relating to our lack of control of joint ventures and our abilities to successfully dispose of certain assets may not be realized; our assumptions and expectations in our financial outlook may prove to be too optimistic; and the Company's expectations and assumptions as of the date of this release regarding potential uninsured loss amounts and on-going investigations resulting from the casualty loss at Avalon at Edgewater (""Edgewater"") are subject to change and could materially affect the Company's current expectations regarding the impact of the casualty loss. Additional discussions of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements appear in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission , including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 under the heading ""Risk Factors"" and under the heading ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Forward-Looking Statements"" and in subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

Definitions and Reconciliations

Non-GAAP financial measures and other capitalized terms, as used in this earnings release, are defined and further explained on Attachment 13, Definitions and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Terms. Attachment 13 is included in the full earnings release available at the Company's website at http://www.avalonbay.com/earnings . This wire distribution includes only definitions and reconciliations of the following non-GAAP financial measures:

Average Rental Rates are calculated by the Company as rental revenue in accordance with GAAP, divided by the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes.

Economic Gain (Loss) is calculated by the Company as the gain (loss) on sale in accordance with GAAP, less accumulated depreciation through the date of sale and any other non-cash adjustments that may be required under GAAP accounting. Management generally considers Economic Gain (Loss) to be an appropriate supplemental measure to gain (loss) on sale in accordance with GAAP because it helps investors to understand the relationship between the cash proceeds from a sale and the cash invested in the sold community. The Economic Gain (Loss) for each of the communities presented is based on their respective final settlement statements. A reconciliation of Economic Gain (Loss) to gain on sale in accordance with GAAP for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 as well as prior years' activities is presented elsewhere in the full release.

Economic Occupancy (""Ec Occ"") is defined as total possible revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of total possible revenue. Total possible revenue (also known as ""gross potential"") is determined by valuing occupied units at contract rates and vacant units at market rents. Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current market rents. By measuring vacant apartments at their market rents, Economic Occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community's gross revenue.

Established Communities are consolidated communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had Stabilized Operations, as defined below, as of the beginning of the respective prior year period. Therefore, for 2017 operating results, Established Communities are consolidated communities that have Stabilized Operations as of January 1, 2016, are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year.

FFO and Core FFO are considered by management to be supplemental measures of our operating and financial performance. FFO is calculated by the Company in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (""NAREIT""). FFO is calculated by the Company as Net income or loss attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for gains or losses on sales of previously depreciated operating communities, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate assets, write-downs of investments in affiliates which are driven by a decrease in the value of depreciable real estate assets held by the affiliate and depreciation of real estate assets, including adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. By excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated operating communities and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating and financial performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Core FFO is the Company's FFO as adjusted for non-core items outlined in the table below. By further adjusting for items that are not considered part of our core business operations, Core FFO can help one compare the core operating and financial performance of the Company between periods. A reconciliation of Net income attributable to common stockholders to FFO and to Core FFO is as follows (dollars in thousands):

(1) In YTD 2016, the Company received insurance proceeds, net of additional 
costs incurred, of $5,732 related to the severe winter storms that occurred in 
the Company's Northeast markets in 2015. For YTD 2016, the Company recognized 
$4,195 of this recovery as an offset to the impairment on depreciable real 
estate of $4,195 recognized in the prior year period. The balance of the net 
insurance proceeds received in 2016 of $1,537 is recognized as a casualty gain 
and is included in the reconciliation of FFO to Core FFO. 
(2) Amounts for 2016 and 2017 are primarily composed of (i) the Company's 
portion of yield maintenance charges incurred for the early repayment of debt 
associated with joint venture disposition activity, (ii) the write-off of

communities in the U.S. Fund and (iii) the Company's proportionate share of 
operating results for joint ventures formed with Equity Residential  as part of 
the Archstone acquisition. 
(3) Amounts for 2017 and 2016 are composed of the Company's recognition of its 
promoted interest in Fund II.

Company had acquired for development and sold in July 2017. Amount for YTD 
2016 includes impairment charges relating to ancillary land parcels. 
(5) Amount for YTD 2017 includes $19,481 for the Maplewood casualty loss, 
partially offset by $17,143 of expected property damage insurance proceeds, a 
portion of which were received during the period. Amount for YTD 2016 includes 
$8,702 in property damage insurance proceeds for the Edgewater casualty loss, 
and $1,537 in insurance proceeds in excess of the total recognized loss 
related to severe winter storms in the Company's Northeast markets that 
occurred in 2015. 
(6) Aggregate impact of (i) Casualty and impairment (recovery) loss, net on 
real estate, (ii) Impairment loss on real estate and (iii) Casualty loss 
(gain), net on real estate, is a loss of $11,688 for YTD 2017, and a gain of 
$3,935 for YTD 2016, respectively. 
(7) Amounts for 2017 are composed of business interruption insurance proceeds 
resulting from the final insurance settlement of the Maplewood casualty loss. 
Amount for YTD 2016 is primarily composed of business interruption insurance

interruption insurance proceeds in Q1 2016. Amounts for 2017 also include 
amounts related to the Maplewood casualty loss in Q1 2017, for which the

Gross Levered IRR is calculated as the internal rate of return on the Company's equity investment in Fund II considering the timing and amounts of capital contributions and distributions, including promoted interest earned on the Company's general partnership interest.

Gross Levered Cash Flow Multiple is calculated as the ratio of the Company's share of distributions from Fund II, including promoted interest earned, to the Company's share of contributions in Fund II.

The calculation of Gross Levered IRR and Gross Levered Cash Flow Multiple excludes all management fees earned by the Company during the investment period.

Initial Year Market Cap Rate is defined by the Company as Projected NOI of a single community for the first 12 months of operations (assuming no repositioning), less estimates for non-routine allowance of approximately $300 - $500 per apartment home, divided by the gross sales price for the community. Projected NOI, as referred to above, represents management's estimate of projected rental revenue minus projected operating expenses before interest, income taxes (if any), depreciation and amortization. For this purpose, management's projection of operating expenses for the community includes a management fee of 2.5% - 3.5%. The Initial Year Market Cap Rate, which may be determined in a different manner by others, is a measure frequently used in the real estate industry when determining the appropriate purchase price for a property or estimating the value for a property. Buyers may assign different Initial Year Market Cap Rates to different communities when determining the appropriate value because they (i) may project different rates of change in operating expenses and capital expenditure estimates and (ii) may project different rates of change in future rental revenue due to different estimates for changes in rent and occupancy levels. The weighted average Initial Year Market Cap Rate is weighted based on the gross sales price of each community.

Interest Coverage is calculated by the Company as Core EBITDA divided by the sum of interest expense, net, and preferred dividends, if applicable. Interest Coverage is presented by the Company because it provides rating agencies and investors an additional means of comparing our ability to service debt obligations to that of other companies. EBITDA is defined by the Company as net income or loss attributable to the Company before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Press Release: AvalonBay Communities, Inc . -5-

NOI is defined by the Company as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excluding corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, investments and investment management expenses, expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries, interest expense, net, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, net, general and administrative expense, joint venture income, depreciation expense, corporate income tax expense, casualty and impairment (gain) loss, net, gain on sale of real estate and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale. The Company considers NOI to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to Net Income of operating performance of a community or communities because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level property management overhead or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community, and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or groups of assets.

A reconciliation of NOI to Net Income, as well as a breakdown of NOI by operating segment, is as follows (dollars in thousands):

Projected NOI, as used within this release for certain development communities and in calculating the Initial Year Market Cap Rate for dispositions, represents management's estimate, as of the date of this release (or as of the date of the buyer's valuation in the case of dispositions), of projected stabilized rental revenue minus projected stabilized operating expenses. For development communities, Projected NOI is calculated based on the first twelve months of Stabilized Operations following the completion of construction. In calculating the Initial Year Market Cap Rate, Projected NOI for dispositions is calculated for the first twelve months following the date of the buyer's valuation. Projected stabilized rental revenue represents management's estimate of projected gross potential minus projected stabilized economic vacancy and adjusted for projected stabilized concessions plus projected stabilized other rental revenue. Projected stabilized operating expenses do not include interest, income taxes (if any), depreciation or amortization, or any allocation of corporate-level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. In addition, projected stabilized operating expenses for development communities do not include property management fee expense. Projected gross potential for development communities and dispositions is based on leased rents for occupied homes and management's best estimate of rental levels for homes which are currently unleased, as well as those homes which will become available for lease during the twelve month forward period used to develop Projected NOI. The weighted average Projected NOI as a percentage of Total Capital Cost is weighted based on the Company's share of the Total Capital Cost of each community, based on its percentage ownership.

Management believes that Projected NOI of the development communities, on an aggregated weighted average basis, assists investors in understanding management's estimate of the likely impact on operations of the development communities when the assets are complete and achieve stabilized occupancy (before allocation of any corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs or interest expense). However, in this release the Company has not given a projection of NOI on a company-wide basis. Given the different dates and fiscal years for which NOI is projected for these communities, the projected allocation of corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs and interest expense to communities under development is complex, impractical to develop, and may not be meaningful. Projected NOI of these communities is not a projection of the Company's overall financial performance or cash flow. There can be no assurance that the communities under development will achieve the Projected NOI as described in this release.

Projected Stabilized Yield (also expressed as ""weighted average initial stabilized yield"" or words of similar meaning) means Projected NOI as a percentage of Total Capital Cost.

Rental Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis is considered by the Company to be a supplemental measure to rental revenue in conformity with GAAP to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on GAAP-based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies. In addition, Rental Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis allows an investor to understand the historical trend in cash concessions.

A reconciliation of rental revenue from Established Communities in conformity with GAAP to Rental Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis is as follows (dollars in thousands):

Stabilized Operations/Restabilized Operations is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.

Total Capital Cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective development or redevelopment community, or development right, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, offset by proceeds from the sale of any associated land or improvements, all as determined in accordance with GAAP. For redevelopment communities, Total Capital Cost excludes costs incurred prior to the start of redevelopment when indicated. With respect to communities where development or redevelopment was completed in a prior or the current period, Total Capital Cost reflects the actual cost incurred, plus any contingency estimate made by management. Total Capital Cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership, either during construction or upon construction completion, represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount. For joint ventures not in construction, Total Capital Cost is equal to gross real estate cost.

Unencumbered NOI as calculated by the Company represents NOI generated by real estate assets unencumbered by outstanding secured debt as of September 30, 2017 as a percentage of total NOI generated by real estate assets. The Company believes that current and prospective unsecured creditors of the Company view Unencumbered NOI as one indication of the borrowing capacity of the Company. Therefore, when reviewed together with the Company's Interest Coverage, EBITDA and cash flow from operations, the Company believes that investors and creditors view Unencumbered NOI as a useful supplemental measure for determining the financial flexibility of an entity. A calculation of Unencumbered NOI for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 is as follows (dollars in thousands):

Unleveraged IRR on sold communities refers to the internal rate of return calculated by the Company considering the timing and amounts of (i) total revenue during the period owned by the Company and (ii) the gross sales price net of selling costs, offset by (iii) the undepreciated capital cost of the communities at the time of sale and (iv) total direct operating expenses during the period owned by the Company. Each of the items (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) is calculated in accordance with GAAP.

The calculation of Unleveraged IRR does not include an adjustment for the Company's general and administrative expense, interest expense, or corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses. Therefore, Unleveraged IRR is not a substitute for Net Income as a measure of our performance. Management believes that the Unleveraged IRR achieved during the period a community is owned by the Company is useful because it is one indication of the gross value created by the Company's acquisition, development or redevelopment, management and sale of a community, before the impact of indirect expenses and Company overhead. The Unleveraged IRR achieved on the communities as cited in this release should not be viewed as an indication of the gross value created with respect to other communities owned by the Company, and the Company does not represent that it will achieve similar Unleveraged IRRs upon the disposition of other communities. The weighted average Unleveraged IRR for sold communities is weighted based on all cash flows over the investment period for each respective community, including net sales proceeds.

The following is a press release from Standard & Poor's : 
 
OVERVIEW 
     -- American Express Credit Account Master Trust 's issuance is an ABS 
transaction backed by a pool of receivables generated by American Express  
credit card accounts and pay-over-time revolving credit features associated 
with charge card accounts that are owned by American Express Centurion Bank  or 
American Express Bank FSB . 
     -- We assigned our ratings to the class A and B certificates from series 
2017-6, 2017-7, and 2017-8. 
     -- The ratings reflect our view of the transaction's credit support, 
underlying payment structure and cash flow mechanics, and the legal structure, 
among other factors. 
 
DALLAS (S&P Global Ratings) Oct. 30, 2017--S&P Global Ratings today assigned 
its ratings to American Express Credit Account Master Trust 's $1.825 billion, 
$782.143 million, and $570.546 million series 2017-6, 2017-7, and 2017-8 
certificates, respectively (see list). 
 
The certificate issuance is an asset-backed securities transaction backed by a 
pool of receivables generated by American Express  credit card accounts and 
pay-over-time revolving credit features associated with charge card accounts 
that are owned by American Express Centurion Bank  or American Express Bank FSB . 
 
The ratings reflect: 
     -- Our view that the credit support for each class of certificates is 
sufficient to withstand the simultaneous stresses we apply for each rating 
category to our 4.75% base-case loss rate assumption, 25.0% base-case payment 
rate assumption, and 18.0% base-case yield assumption. In addition, we use 
stressed purchase rate, excess spread, and certificate interest rate 
assumptions to determine if sufficient credit support is available for the 
ratings. All of the stress assumptions outlined above are based on our current 
criteria and assumptions (see ""U.S. Credit Card Securitizations: Methodology 
And Assumptions,"" published Aug. 24, 2017). 
     -- Our view that the 7% minimum transferor percentage is sufficient in 
our stress scenarios to absorb dilutions, or noncash reductions, in the 
receivables. 
     -- Our expectation that under a moderate ('BBB') stress scenario, all 
else being equal, our ratings will remain within one rating category of the 
assigned 'AAA (sf)' and 'AA+ (sf)' ratings in the next 12 months, based on our 
credit stability criteria (for more information, see ""Methodology: Credit 
Stability Criteria,"" published May 3, 2010). 
     -- Our view of the credit risk inherent in the collateral loan pool based 
on our economic forecast, the trust portfolio's historical performance, the 
collateral characteristics, and vintage performance data. 
     -- The corporate credit ratings we assigned to American Express Travel 
Related Services Co. Inc . (TRS; A-/Stable/--), the servicer, and the 
originators, American Express Centurion Bank  (A-/Stable/A-2) and American 
Express Bank FSB  (A-/Stable/A-2). 
     -- TRS' servicing and collection experience and general operational 
practices. 
     -- Our opinion of the quality and consistency of FSB's and Centurion's 
account origination, underwriting, and account management practices. 
     -- Our expectation of the timely interest and the ultimate principal 
payments by the legal final maturity date, based on stressed cash flow 
modeling scenarios using assumptions commensurate with the assigned 'AAA (sf)' 
and 'AA+ (sf)' ratings. 
     -- The series 2017-6, 2017-7, and 2017-8 certificates' underlying payment 
structure and cash flow mechanics and the transaction's legal structure.

Gary W. Rollins , Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Rollins, Inc. stated, ""We are pleased with the overall revenue results our Company reported for the third quarter and first nine months of this year. For the quarter revenue increased 6.2% and 6.0% year-to-date.

We were disappointed however with the impact to profitability that Hurricane Harvey had on several of the Company's regions: Southwest and North Texas, South Central Commercial, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Mississippi. These areas were negatively impacted by pre-hurricane preparation, flood conditions, closed branches, and our inability to service many of our customers.

Fortunately our people were unharmed, and where appropriate we compensated them even when they were unable to work. Our Employee Relief Fund has also been beneficial to many impacted employees. Hurricane Irma followed at the end of August with a similar effect in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana.

Some good news, on August 1, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Northwest Exterminating. Northwest was established in 1951 and services approximately 120,000 customers in Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, North Carolina and South Carolina. The purchase of this outstanding company will expand our presence in the Southeast. This acquisition provides significant opportunity for both Rollins and Northwest to grow and learn from each other. We see many benefits from this combination.""

2017-10-16,ZBRA,Press Release: Zebra Technologies Honored by Brandon Hall Group with Three Learning Excellence Awards,"Zebra Technologies Honored by Brandon Hall Group with Three Learning Excellence Awards

Honors demonstrate Zebra's commitment to innovative learning, user adoption and change management ","
LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 16, 2017-- 

Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ: ZBRA), the market leader in rugged mobile computers, barcode scanners and barcode printers enhanced with software and services to enable real-time enterprise visibility, today announced the company received the coveted Brandon Hall Group award for excellence in three categories: the Silver award for Best Learning Program Supporting a Change Transformation Business Strategy as well as Bronze awards for Best Use of Video for Learning and Best Use of Virtual Worlds for Learning.

The Silver award for Best Learning Program Supporting a Change Transformation Business Strategy highlights Zebra's business transformation journey following its acquisition of the enterprise business from Motorola Solutions, Inc . Accenture and Zebra's Change Management teams ensured business readiness through learning and communications supporting the largest integration of systems and processes in Zebra's history with the goal of building One Zebra.

The Bronze award for Best Use of Video for Learning recognizes Zebra's use of 3D animation videos, applying the same innovation used in our solutions to our learning tools. This also enables new opportunities for customer user adoption and expands the possibilities of what Zebra can offer to address their business challenges.

The Bronze Award for Best Use of Virtual Worlds for Learning leverages the 3D interactive models of new devices, making them virtually accessible to Zebra's sales team before units are physically available for a broader audience. Learners can orbit and look at them from various angles and distances based on what they want to explore at the given moment. Key selling points and physical device feature annotations were added to give context. This was used for the TC8000 touch mobile computer, MP7000 grocery scanner scale, and the ZT600 Series industrial printers.

SUPPORTING QUOTES

Mike Cooke, CEO, Brandon Hall Group

These are executives and directors of world-class organizations who have done the hard work necessary to drive business results through learning, talent management, leadership development, talent acquisition, and workforce management. They have compelling stories to tell that you cannot get anywhere else.""

Rachel Cooke, COO, Brandon Hall Group and Head of the Awards Program

""Excellence Award winners symbolize the power and impact that Human Capital Management (HCM) practices can have on a business or on any organization.

The Cincinnati-based company now has cloud-computning deals with Google 's parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Pivotal Software . Kroger has no such deal with Amazon Web Services , the world's largest cloud-computing service. Amazon.com is increasingly seen as a threat to grocers since it purchased Whole Foods Market this summer.

""A number of companies have started to look down that path for a Plan B,"" said Kellie Meiman, managing partner at DC-based consulting firm McLarty Associates and a former US Trade Representative official during the Clinton Administration. Speaking at a seminar in Detroit on Wednesday, Meiman said options include lobbying for legislation requiring Congressional consultation or an International Trade Commission impact study, she said. Another possibility is a constitutional challenge to Section 151 of the Trade Act of 1974, which grants presidential termination and withdrawal authority, she said.

1405 ET - At an investor conference Wednesday, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said Sprint 's network, while improved in recent years, is nowhere near its potential. Now that it won't be merging with T-Mobile , Claure says Sprint will spend billions of dollars more each year on network improvements, such as installing 2.5 GHz spectrum on all its towers. That means capex will rise as it spends more of its cash reserves. Claure said customers are more likely to leave if they live in places where the network doesn't work well. Because it's network isn't as good as rivals, ""I don't think we've given Sprint fully the right chance to compete,"" he said. (Ryan.Knutson@wsj.com)

1401 ET - Italy bans big cruise ships from sailing into Venice's Grand Canal after protests by conservation groups that the giant vessels are overwhelming the popular tourist destination and damaging its lagoons. Cruisers operated by companies like Royal Caribbean International , Carnival Cruise Line and Norwegian Cruise Line will be diverted at the neighboring industrial town of Marghera through a less scenic route, leaving the canal to its traditional gondolas and water taxis. (costas.paris@wsj.com)

1357 ET - Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said at an investor conference Wednesday that scrapping the T-Mobile merger came down to control, confirming a recent WSJ report detailing how talks fell apart. ""We figured out that having a telco in the largest market in the world was something that was strategic,"" Claure said of the thinking of Sprint parent SoftBank's board. Claure said that wireless connectivity will be central to future businesses like cars and robotics. (Ryan.Knutson@wsj.com)

1241 ET - Analysts are asking if Wendy's --which reported 3Q earnings Wednesday--is struggling with its market share. AllianceBernstein says in a research note that the company's two big competitors, Burger King and McDonald's , had better comps for the quarter, ""suggesting (Wendy's ) may be struggling to hold share amidst value onslaught."" RBC Capital Markets says Wendy's could be seeing the impact from Carrols Restaurant Group , which owns almost 800 US Burger King restaurants. ""Our guess is that Carrol's geographic footprint--being primarily in the Northeast--has hurt Wendy's , which seemed to imply a slight slowdown in the first half of 4Q."" In Wendy's conference call Wednesday, CEO Todd Penegor says, ""We continue to hold our own."" (allison.prang@wsj.com; @AllisonPrang)

1237 ET - Imports of foreign-made steel to the US rose 12% in September to 3.1M tons, as the US's closest trading partners stepped up their shipments. Imports from Mexico, Canada and the European Union rose by 30%, 20% and 28% respectively from year earlier, says the American Iron and Steel Institute and industry forecaster Bradford Research. Imports from China, which has been widely criticized in recent years for flooding the world market with its steel, dropped nearly 40% in September as a result of steep US tariffs and higher prices for steel inside China. While steel company executives continue to urge the Trump Administration to impose board-based tariffs on imports, several have asked Canada and Mexico be to spared. US steel producers rely on mills in the Nafta countries to supply steel to US customers and US mills. (robert.tita@wsj.com)

1214 ET - Equifax 's interim chief executive Paulino do Rego Barros says he doesn't know if certain consumer data on Equifax 's systems is unencrypted at rest in questioning from Sen Cory Gardner (R, Colo) at a Senate committee hearing. Barros has been the company's interim CEO since late Sept. If data is unencrypted at rest that means that if hackers get access to the company's systems that store the data, they can read the data without many, if any, hurdles. (annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com; robert.mcmillan@wsj.com)

1200 ET - The Equifax hearing in the Senate Commerce Committee is now focusing on a lingering question: the role of John J Kelley , Equifax's chief legal officer, in approving stock trades by company executives in the days after the company first discovered suspicious activity in its systems. A special committee of Equifax 's board said the executives didn't know about the suspicious activity when they sold stock, but didn't address what Kelley knew at the time. People familiar with the matter have told The Wall Street Journal that Kelley was informed of the suspicious activity July 30, before the executives sold their shares. Sen Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc, called the situation ""totally inappropriate."" Pauiino de Rego Barros Jr, Equifax 's interim CEO, said ""I think it's not my perspective to say whether it's appropriate or not"" and noted that the special committee is still investigating the process.

1158 ET - The maker of Humvee vehicles has filed suit against Activision Blizzard for allegedly using its trademarks in the videogame company's Call of Duty franchise, as well as in marketing promotions for it. AM General LLC of South Bend, Ind., is seeking a permanent injunction, according to a complaint filed in the Southern District of New York Tuesday. Monetary damages weren't specified. Call of Duty is Activision 's biggest franchise, analysts say. A new installment released last week generated more than $500M in retail sales world-wide in its first three days, exceeding sales of the previous edition, though not the one before that.

1150 ET - The time may have come for Texas oilmen to ditch the popular expression ""we've been through this rodeo before,"" which was often heard after the 2014 collapse in oil prices. Shan Jegatheeswaran, VP of sales operations and commercial integration at Baker Hughes, says young people new to the industry should instead lead innovation efforts to change operations, designs and equipment ""to build a product that is truly superior in the current state."" Speaking at the Operational Excellence oil and gas conference in Houston, he says many people have been in the oil business longer than he's been alive, and says the solution to price slumps or other problems can no longer be ""we'll figure it out, we've been through this cycle before.""

PR Newswire","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov. 8, 2017

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov. 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ ---- LiCo Energy Metals Inc . (""the Company"" or ""LiCo"") (TSX-V: LIC) (OTCQB: WCTXF) is pleased to report the assay results for the first five diamond drill holes (GB17-01 to GB17-05) from the on-going drill program on the Glencore Bucke Property located 6km northeast of Cobalt, Ontario.

""We are exceptionally pleased with the grade and the widths of the cobalt mineralization that has been intersected"", says Tim Fernback , President & CEO of LiCo and, ""the drill program has been successful as cobalt mineralization has been intersected in every hole"".

The most significant results are as follows: 


   -- GB17-01    -         0.31% Co over 3.0 m from 18.0 to 21 .0 m, incl. 0.71 
      % Co over 1.13 m 
 
   -- GB17-04    -         1.6% Co over 0.5 m from 16.25 to 16.75 m, incl. 
      3,11% Co, 0.17% Cu, 0.69% Zn over 0.25 m 
 
   -- GB17-03    -         0.27% Co over 1.75 m from 27.15 to 28.9 m, incl. 
      0.44% Co over 0.75 m 
 
   -- GB17-03    -         0.39% Co over 0.25 m from 31.25 to 31.5 m 
 
   -- GB17-02    -         0.42% Co,0.2% Cu,2.2% Pb over 0.3 m from 39.37 to 
      39.67 m 
 
   -- GB17-03    -         1.02% Cu, 294 ppm, Co, 12 ppm Ag, 204 ppm Zn, 689 
      ppm Pb over 2.5 m 

The results for the first five holes are summarized in Table 1 below. To date, a total of 19 diamond drill holes totaling 1,565 m have been completed on the Glencore Bucke Property, testing the Northwest and Main Zones. The drilling has confirmed and extended the cobalt mineralization on the property and which are consistent with historical grades and widths in the overall Cobalt Camp. The second drill testing the Teledyne property has completed 4 holes for 804 metres to date. The drill program is designed to provide the company with sufficient drill hole information to create a geological model and a 43-101 complaint resource estimate.

""It is significant that the drilling has confirmed the historical cobalt style mineralization in both grade and widths which was historically mined by other companies within the Cobalt Camp"" commented Dwayne Melrose, Technical Advisor for LiCo. ""As the cobalt and associated (copper, silver, lead and zinc) mineralization that was intersected is close to surface, this could potentially make the property attractive for a future toll milling scenario"".

QA/QC Program

LiCo Energy Metals Inc . has implemented a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) program for both the Glencore Bucke and Teledyne Property drill programs.

Diamond drill core was logged, then sawed in half, with one half placed in a labelled bag, and the remaining half placed back into the core box and stored in a secured compound. Either a standard or a blank was inserted every 20 sample. All samples were shipped to Activation Laboratories in Ancaster, Ontario. Each sample is coarsely crushed and a 250 g aliquot is pulverized for analysis. From here, 0.5 g of the sample is digested with aqua regia for 2 hours at 95 degC. The sample is cooled and then diluted with deionized water. The sample is then analyzed using an Agilent 700 series ICP for the 38 element suite. QC for the digestion is 15% for each batch, 2 method reagent blanks, 6 in-house controls, 8 sample duplicates and 5 certified reference materials. An additional 20% QC is performed as part of the instrumental analysis to ensure quality in the areas of instrumental drift. If over limits for Cu, Pb, Zn, and Co are encountered, a sodium peroxide fusion, acid dissolution followed by ICP-OES is completed. For Ag over limits, a four acid digestion is completed followed by ICP-OES.

Qualified Person

The Glencore Bucke and Teledyne Properties are managed by Joerg Kleinboeck, P.Geo., (LiCo's QP), and supervised by Dwayne Melrose, Director and Head of the Technical Advisory Board of LiCo.

The overall drilling program will be conducted as part of LiCo's flow thru financing and work commitments for the Glencore Bucke and Teledyne Properties.

About LiCo Energy Metals : https://licoenergymetals.com/ 

LiCo Energy Metals Inc . is a Canadian based exploration company whose primary listing is on the TSX Venture Exchange . The Company's focus is directed towards exploration for high value metals integral to the manufacture of lithium ion batteries.

Glencore Bucke Cobalt Project, Cobalt, Ontario: The Company has entered into a property purchase agreement to acquire a 100% interest from Glencore Canada Corporation (subsidiary of Glencore plc ) in the Glencore Bucke Property, situated in Bucke Township, 6 km east-northeast of Cobalt, Ontario, subject to a back-in provision, production royalty and off-take agreement. Strategically, the Glencore Bucke Property consists of 16.2 hectares and sits along the west boundary of LiCo's Teledyne Cobalt Project. The Property covers the southern extension of the #3 vein that was historically mined on the neighbouring Cobalt Contact Property located to the north of the Glencore Bucke Property. Diamond drilling in 1981 on the Glencore Bucke Property delineated two zones of mineralization measuring 150 m and 70 m in length.

Ontario Teledyne Cobalt Project:

The Company has an option to earn 100% ownership, subject to a royalty, in the Teledyne Project located near Cobalt. Ontario. The Property adjoins the south and west boundaries of claims that hosted the Agaunico Mine. From 1905 through to 1961, the Agaunico Mine produced a total of 4,350,000 lbs. of cobalt and 980,000 oz. of silver. A significant portion of the cobalt that was produced at the Agaunico Mine located along structures that extended southward onto property currently under option to LiCo Energy Metals .

Chile Purickuta Lithium Project:

The Purickuta Project is located within Salar de Atacama, a salt flat encompassing 3,000 km2, being about 100 km long, 80 km wide and home to approximately 37% of the worlds Lithium production. The salar possesses a very high grade of both Lithium (1,840mg/l) and Potassium (22,630mg/l and is close to power, labour, communications, transportation and other infrastructure. The property of 160 hectares is enveloped by a concession owned by Sociedad Quimica y Minera (""SQM"") and lies, significantly, within a few kilometers of the property of CORFO (the Chilean Economic Development Agency) where its leases to both SQM and Albermarle's Rockwood Lithium Corp Together these two companies have combined production of over 62,000 tonnes of LCE (Lithium Carbonate Equivalent) annually making up 100% of Chile's current lithium output. The unique characteristics of Salar de Atacama make finished lithium carbonate easier and cheaper to produce than any of its peer group globally.

Purickuta is a smaller exploitation concession rather than a large exploration concession thereby accelerating the task of taking the project to production once a measured reserve can be established. Currently, the Chilean government retains ownership of lithium separate from other minerals and thus production can only proceed upon receipt of a special lithium operation contract know as a ""CEOL"". In the future, it will be necessary for LiCo and partner to negotiate a production contract with CORFO concurrently with completing any positive feasibility study. ""Chile, which has one of the world's most plentiful supplies of lithium, is pushing ahead with new policies to develop those reserves"". (Reuters Jan 2, 2017).

Nevada Dixie Valley Lithium Project:

The Company has an option to acquire a 100% interest, subject to a 3% NSR, on a large lithium exploration project at the Humboldt Salt Marsh in Dixie Valley, Nevada. The geologic setting and presence of lithium in active geothermal fluids and surface salts in Dixie Valley match characteristics of producing lithium brine deposits at Clayton Valley, Nevada and in South America.

Nevada Black Rock Desert Lithium Project:

8 Nov 2017 08:30 ET 
Press Release: LiCo Intersects Good Grade Cobalt -2-

The Company has entered into an option agreement whereby the Company may earn an undivided 100% interest, subject to a 3% NSR, in the Black Rock Desert Lithium Project in southwest Black Rock Desert, Washoe County, Nevada.

The Company is planning an exploration programs on a number of its properties over the next several months. The technical content of this news release has been reviewed and approved Joerg Kleinboeck, P.Geo., an independent consulting geologist and a qualified person as defined in NI 43-101.

Sprint shares fell 12% premarket after the telecom giant and T-Mobile US Inc. officially called off their merger Saturday, ending months of talks about a tie-up that would have united the nation's No. 3 and No. 4 wireless carriers. T-Mobile shares fell 5.1%.","Qualcomm shares rose 5% to $64.90 before the opening bell after Broadcom Ltd. formally announced a proposal to acquire the chip maker for $70 per share in cash and stock, a roughly 13% premium over Qualcomm's Friday closing price. Media reports about the deal began surfacing Friday.

Apple shares rose 0.1% premarket to $172.63. If shares of the iPhone maker hit $175.30, Apple will become the first public U.S. company to reach $900 billion in market value.

Advanced Micro Devices shares climbed 8.3% premarket after The Wall Street Journal reported that Intel Corp. plans to announce a laptop-computer chip that combines an Intel processor and an AMD graphics unit, a partnership aimed at thwarting common competitor Nvidia Corp.. Nvidia shares were down 0.9% premarket, while Intel shares rose 1.3%.

Shares of Amazon.com fell 0.1% before the opening bell. The e-commerce giant has quietly started lowering prices by as much as 9% in recent weeks on goods offered by independent merchants on its site, ratcheting up a price war with other retail giants -- and potentially straining its relationship with some sellers.

Valeant shares climbed 3% premarket following the company's announcement that it will sell its Sprout Pharmaceuticals subsidiary to former Sprout shareholders, after they accused the struggling pharmaceutical giant of botching the marketing of Sprout's female libido treatment Addyi.

Shares of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway were down 0.8%. The conglomerate reported a 43% drop in quarterly profit after the market closed Friday, as costly disasters drove the company's insurance operations to a loss.

CVS Health Corp. shares fell 0.3% premarket after the pharmacy giant's narrow quarterly earnings beat. The firm is in talks to buy insurer Aetna for more than $66 billion.

Shares of Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. climbed 0.8% before the opening bell following the luxury fashion company's sales and profits in the most recent quarter topped Wall Street expectations. The firm also raised its 2018 earnings and revenue outlook.

Mylan N.V. shares rose 1.5% premarket. The drug company missed on earnings and revenue in the most recent quarter but raised the low end of its projected range for full-year earnings.

Shares of Anthem Inc. were little changed premarket after the insurance company confirmed a Friday Wall Street Journal report that CEO Joseph Swedish is stepping down. Anthem named Gail Boudreaux, former chief executive of UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s insurance business, its new chief executive.

VIENNA, Nov. 6, 2017

VIENNA, Nov. 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- (Booth X67) -- West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc . (NYSE: WST), a global leader in innovative solutions for injectable drug administration, today announced it will, for the first time, showcase new extensions of its marketed SmartDose(R) drug delivery platform, including several new wearable injectors that allow for up to 10 mL of volume to be injected in easy-to-use, wearable formats. In addition, West will lead several educational sessions and presentations at the PDA Universe of Pre-filled Syringes and Injection Devices, taking place November 7-8, 2017 in Vienna, Austria, to address the pharmaceutical industry's top concerns regarding the containment and delivery of injectable medicines.

""Advancements in drug development need to be paired with advances in drug delivery, such as last year's FDA approval of the first combination product using our SmartDose drug delivery platform. Based on this technology, we are now excited to share our expanded portfolio of SmartDose wearable injectors,"" said Eric Resnick , Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at West. ""As our customers continue to innovate and bring to market exciting new therapies to address important unmet medical needs, West is ready to help them with advancements in drug containment and delivery and technical expertise to guide them through the drug development and approval process.""

West's SmartDose drug delivery platform allows patients to self-administer medication in accordance with their prescribed treatment. West developed this wearable device with extensive human factors testing and analysis to understand the interaction between the patient and the delivery system. All versions of the SmartDose platform adhere to the patient's body, usually on the abdomen, so patients can be hands free during administration. The SmartDose platform offers a variety of integrated solutions for delivery and containment featuring a silicone-free Daikyo Crystal Zenith(R) cartridge and a FluroTec(R) coated piston containment system. West has built upon the success of the Generation I (Gen. I) device to address market needs for higher-dose volumes and enhanced functionality and usability and now offers for development: 


   -- SmartDose Gen. II device, a system that can accommodate injection volumes 
      of up to 10 mL, as well as both glass and Daikyo Crystal Zenith 
      containers. 
 
   -- SmartDose Gen. III device, a preloaded version, that reduces user steps

2017-11-07,SBAC,Food Distributors Hurt by Sysco 's Hurricane Hit -- Market Talk,"1139 ET - Sysco falls 4% on 1Q earnings that showed a heavy impact on inflation in food prices, along with a $10M hit from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. The world's largest food distributor saw a lost of sales from restaurants that closed from the storms, executives said in discussing 2018 results for the period. Inflation in food leapt up 4% during the quarter, particularly driven by meat, poultry and dairy. Food prices had been deflationary for a record period of months. Rival food distributors also down, including Performance Food Group , United Natural Foods , US Foods and SpartanNash. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)","1131 ET - The shareholder push for shale discipline in spending and a greater focus on returns and free cash flow appears to be working, leading a number of companies to make changes and setting the stage for more in the weeks to come, according to Tudor Pickering Holt. Investors have fled the oil and gas sector after repeatedly losing money during an era of lower prices in the last three years, but they have signaled that they would come back to the sector if company leaders promised to hold back spending and put return on capital first, Tudor Pickering said. (bradley.olson@wsj.com; @bradnews)

1128 ET - The success rate for hostile bids is pretty paltry, with more than 60% of them failing, according to data provider Dealogic. Broadcom 's hostile approach to Qualcomm seems especially difficult. For one, the size of the offer, at more than $100B, could be an issue. ""It should be noted how difficult it has been over recent years to succeed at hostile transactions and none have been remotely close to the size and scope of this one,"" writes FBN Securities . ""In our view, this would be a complicated deal to complete even on a friendly basis,"" the note says. In addition to regular-way hostile hurdles, Qualcomm last year struck a deal for NXP that it is trying to close, which could make it that much harder for Broadcom to disrupt. Qualcomm shares are up 1.5%; Qualcomm slips 0.4%. (dana.mattioli@wsj.com; @DanaMattioli)

1120 ET - Combining Sprint and T-Mobile might not have raised wireless service rates, but it would have kept them from falling as quickly, according to Moody's Investors Service . The bond-rating firm warns ""prices could take another leg down"" as both companies try to fight off market leaders AT&T and Verizon --good news for consumers, less so for investors. Moody's expects each company to counter that trend with differentiation, with AT&T bundling video and wireless and Verizon focusing on 5G networks. ""T-Mobile is likely to continue its successful strategy that focuses on balancing value, simplicity and continually improving service quality,"" Moody's adds, while ""Sprint looks poised to pursue MVNO partnerships with the cable industry,"" its recent deal with Altice being an example. (andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com; @drewfitzgerald)

1112 ET - A study raising questions about certain uses of coronary stents could cause a decline in implantation procedures, but Wells Fargo expects it will be modest and have a small financial impact on manufacturers. The study, ""Orbita,"" concluded that stents implanted in patients to alleviate chest pain didn't significantly improve exercise time in patients versus those getting a sham procedure. Wells Fargo sees less than a 5% reduction in US stent procedures over the next year as a result of the study, which would cut sales by less than 1% for major manufacturers Abbott Labs , Boston Scientific and Medtronic , relative to each company's total sales.

Its stores will then reopen at 6am on Friday. In past years, Target kept stores open throughout the night until they closed on Friday. The new hours ""reflect when we have seen the most shopping in stores for the past several years,"" Target says. The retailer plans to offer select deals starting today to lure shoppers to its website and stores before the holidays. (khadeeja.safdar@wsj.com, @khadeeja_safdar)

1055 ET - The whole wireless industry takes it on the chin after T-Mobile and Sprint publicly called off merger talks, citing an impasse over terms. Sprint falls hardest, down 12% to $5.86, while T-Mobile slips 5.5% to $55.69. Rivals AT&T and Verizon drop 1.5% and 5%, respectively, putting the sector in negative territory this year, with all but T-Mobile down double digits.

10:47ET - Oil's rally to $56/bbl comes at a much-needed time for OPEC-member Venezuela, whose finances are in disarray after US sanctions and opposition pressure successfully blocked it from issuing new government debt to pay off old debt. But Risa Grais-Targow at Eurasia Group tells WSJ higher oil prices won't fix much for struggling President Maduro. She says Venezuela's already-falling oil production, about 1.9M bpd, may accelerate lower into 2018 amid weakening internal support, thus offsetting potential revenue-bumps from higher prices. Venezuela announced it will restructure its debt after it tried to issue a new, $3.5B-$5B bond that was ""vetoed by Donald Trump at the behest of [opposition legislator] Julio Borges ,"" Maduro said.

1030 ET - On Deck Capital shares fall 3% after the online lender reported weaker-than-expected 3Q results. On Deck lost $4.5M, or 6 cents per share, in 3Q, while analysts were looking for a profit of 2 cents per share. CEO Noah Breslow said that On Deck had to set aside funds to gird for potential loan defaults in areas hit by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and that absent those natural disasters, the company would have been closer to breaking even. On Deck said it expected to report a GAAP profit in the fourth quarter. (peter.rudegeair@wsj.com; @rudegeair)

1018 ET - Third-party sales have become more dominant on Amazon. Those merchants are expected to account for roughly 70% of the estimated $340.71B of merchandise bought on Amazon this year, according to FactSet forecasts. That's a problem for some brands and manufacturers, who are having more trouble controlling distribution and supply chain thanks to the trend. (laura.stevens@wsj.com; @laurastevenswsj)

1012 ET - Amazon is choosing to lower the price on some third-party sellers' goods, a move that could further strain Amazon's complicated relationship with big-name brands, manufacturers and its merchants. While it may increase sellers' sales in some cases, it could also cause them to violate a wholesalers' minimum advertised price or its contracts with other marketplaces. Amazon bears the cost. (laura.stevens@wsj.com; @laurastevenswsj)

1009 ET - Coffee futures slide as traders search for a bottom in a contract Societe Generale says is ""oversold."" Recent rains and large stockpiles of coffee have added to the bearish sentiment.

Press Release: S&PGR Raises Franklin Adj U.S. Gov Sec Fund Rtg To 'AA+f'","
 
 
The following is a press release from Standard & Poor's : 
 
SAN FRANCISCO (S&P Global Ratings) Nov. 6, 2017--S&P Global Ratings today said 
it raised its fund credit quality rating (FCQR) on Franklin Adjustable U.S. 
Government Securities Fund to 'AA+f' from 'AAf'. At the same time, we affirmed 
the 'S1' fund volatility ratings (FVRs) on the underlying portfolio. 
 
We have also removed the ratings from under criteria observation (UCO). We 
designated the ratings as UCO on June 26, 2017, following the publication of 
criteria pertaining to the assessment on this portfolio (see ""Fixed-Income 
Funds Ratings Placed Under Criteria Observation On Publication Of Revised 
Criteria"" and ""S&P Global Ratings Publishes Fund Credit Quality And Fund 
Volatility Ratings Criteria,"" published June 26, 2017). 
 
The 'AA+f' FCQR signifies that the credit quality of the portfolio exposures 
is very strong. When undertaking our assessment following the publication of 
the criteria, we have determined that the credit risk profile of the 
underlying portfolios of the fund was consistent with a 'AA+f' FCQR. The 
change in the FCQR reflects the application of our revised FCQR methodology, 
rather than a shift in the investment policy of the fund. When determining the 
FCQRs, we first ascertained a preliminary FCQR through our quantitative 
assessment of a fund's portfolio credit risk via our fund credit quality 
matrix. The assessment reflects the weighted average credit risk of the 
portfolios of investments. The quantitative assessment of the Franklin 
Adjustable U.S. Government Securities Fund, which invests predominantly in 
adjustable-rate mortgage securities (ARMS) that are issued or guaranteed by 
the U.S. government , its agencies or instrumentalities, is consistent with 
'AA+f'. We have a strong qualitative assessment of Franklin Advisers Inc . and 
a neutral assessment of portfolio risk. 
 
The qualitative assessment entailed a review of the investment manager's 
management and organization, risk management and compliance, credit culture, 
and credit research. The portfolio risk assessment focused on four indicators: 
counterparty risk, concentration risk, liquidity, and fund credit score 
cushion (the proximity of the preliminary FCQR to a fund rating threshold). 
 
The affirmation of the 'S1' FVR signifies that the fund exhibits low 
volatility of returns comparable to a portfolio of short-duration government 
securities, typically maturing within one to three years and denominated in 
the base currency of the fund. We determined the FVR by assessing the 
historical volatility and dispersion of fund returns relative to reference 
indices. Next, we evaluated portfolio risk taking into account duration, 
credit exposures, liquidity, derivatives, leverage, foreign currency, and 
investment concentration. Given the determination that these portfolio risk 
factors were consistent, there was no adjustment to the preliminary FVR 
derived in review of return volatility and dispersion. We then used our strong 
qualitative assessment to determine that no adjustment was required to the 
FVR. 
 
We performed a comparable rating analysis on the Franklin Adjustable U.S. 
Government Securities Fund with other funds that have similar portfolio 
strategy and composition. Here we focused on a holistic view of the fund's 
portfolio credit quality and characteristics relative to its peers. The 
comparative rating analysis did not result in any adjustment to the rating. 
 
The Franklin Adjustable U.S. Government Securities Fund is part of the 
Franklin Investors Securities Trust. The fund seeks a high level of current 
income while providing lower volatility of principal than a fund that invests 
in fixed-rate securities. The fund invests predominantly in ARMS that are 
issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government , its agencies, or 
instrumentalities. The fund's investments may include securities issued by 
government-sponsored entities, such as Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac . Franklin 
Advisers Inc . serves as the investment manager and is a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Franklin Resources Inc ., which is a global investment management 
organization operating as Franklin Templeton Investments . As of June 30, 2017, 
Franklin Templeton Investments  had more than $742 billion in assets under 
management. The Bank of New York  Mellon is the custodian, and Franklin 
Templeton Services LLC serves as the fund administrator and transfer agent. 
 
An FCQR, also known as a ""bond fund rating,"" is a forward-looking opinion 
about the overall credit quality of a fixed-income investment fund. FCQRs, 
identified by the 'f' suffix, are assigned to fixed-income funds, actively or 
passively managed, typically exhibiting variable net asset values. The ratings 
reflect the credit risks of the portfolio investments, the level of the fund's 
counterparty risk, and the risk of the fund's management ability and 
willingness to maintain current fund credit quality. Unlike traditional credit 
ratings (e.g., issuer credit ratings), a fund credit quality rating does not 
address a fund's ability to meet payment obligations and is not a commentary 
on yield levels. 
 
An FVR is a forward-looking opinion about a fixed-income investment fund's 
volatility of returns relative to that of a ""reference index"" denominated in 
the base currency of the fund. A reference index is composed of government 
securities associated with the fund's base currency. FVRs are not globally 
comparable. FVRs reflect our expectation of the fund's future volatility of 
returns to remain consistent with its historical volatility of returns. FVRs 
reflect S&P Global Ratings' view of the fund's sensitivity to interest rate 
risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk, as well as other factors that may 
affect returns such as use of derivatives, use of leverage, exposure to 
foreign currency risk and investment concentration, and fund management. 
Different symbology is used to distinguish fund volatility ratings from S&P 
Global Ratings' traditional issue or issuer credit ratings. We do so because 
fund volatility ratings do not reflect creditworthiness but rather our view of 
a fund's volatility of returns. 
 
We review pertinent fund information and portfolio reports monthly as part of 
our surveillance process for our fund ratings.

Second Quarter of Fiscal 2018 Earnings Results Demonstrate that Strategy is Working","Urges Stockholders to Vote ""FOR"" All of Deckers' Highly Qualified Director Nominees on the WHITE Proxy Card TODAY 


GOLETA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 10, 2017-- 

Deckers Brands (NYSE: DECK), a global leader in designing, marketing and distributing innovative footwear, apparel and accessories, announced today that its Board of Directors is sending a letter to stockholders highlighting the Board's confidence in its transformation strategy, which is further emphasized by the recently announced $400 million stock repurchase authority. The proxy statement and other important information related to the Company's 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on December 14, 2017, can be found on Deckers' website at www.votedeckers.com.

Deckers' Board of Directors unanimously recommends that stockholders vote ""FOR"" ALL nine of Deckers' highly qualified, experienced nominees using the WHITE proxy card today.

VOTE THE ENCLOSED WHITE PROXY CARD TODAY FOR DECKERS' HIGHLY QUALIFIED DIRECTORS

The full text of the letter follows:

November 10, 2017

Dear Fellow Stockholder:

At our upcoming Annual Meeting of Stockholders on December 14, 2017, you will be asked to make an important decision regarding the future direction of our company and the value of your investment.

Your Board of Directors and management team are transforming Deckers in order to win in this environment and meet the challenges posed by the sweeping changes in the retail and branded products industries. This transformation is already delivering increased stockholder value and positioning Deckers to create even more stockholder value in the future. We are confident in our future prospects, and our latest quarterly results and recently announced plan to repurchase $400 million of our stock are strong signals that Deckers is on the right path.

Despite the progress that we have made, Marcato Capital Management continues to persist in a distracting and expensive proxy contest to replace every current director and install its own slate of nominees on our Board, none of whom we have been allowed to meet. We believe that the election of Marcato's unvetted nominees will derail the progress and momentum that we have made, lead to executive departures and put the value of your investment in Deckers at risk.

Your vote ""FOR"" ALL nine of Deckers' directors is a vote to continue a transformation strategy that is producing solid results. We urge you to vote today on the WHITE proxy card. Please simply disregard the Gold proxy card sent to you by Marcato.

OUR RECENT EARNINGS RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT OUR TRANSFORMATION STRATEGY IS WORKING

During our most recent quarter, we delivered: 


   -- Higher gross margins: Gross margin increased to 46.7% from 44.5% for the 
      same period last year. 
 
   -- Greater profitability: Operating income was $67.4 million, an increase of 
      approximately 24.8% compared to $54.0 million for the same period last 
      year. 
 
   -- Improved earnings: Diluted earnings per share were $1.54, an increase of 
      approximately 27.3% compared to $1.21 for the same period last year. 
 
   -- Sustainable revenue growth: Stronger HOKA ONE ONE brand and 
      direct-to-consumer (DTC) channel performance led to an increase in our 
      outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2018. 

OUR TRANSFORMATION STRATEGY IS PROACTIVELY ADDRESSING RAPIDLY EVOLVING CONSUMER SHOPPING PRACTICES

Using our Board's broad knowledge of brands, retail and technology, along with management's expertise, we constantly rethink and reposition every aspect of our business and organization to ensure that we have the right omni-channel strategies to capitalize on the new ways that consumers want to interact with our brands--whether through a Deckers-owned store or outlet, a third-party retailer, a partner retail store or online.

Optimizing Our Retail Store Strategy

Our retail store presence remains an integral component of growing the business, consistently exceeding consumer expectations and meeting their demands and increasing the intrinsic value of the UGG brand by showcasing its breadth. To ensure that our retail strategy meets our rigorous investment requirements and delivers the most value for stockholders, we continue to close inefficient and underperforming stores and transfer some international stores to partners. In addition, we are moving certain stores in key markets to higher traffic locations and evolving our design for our concept stores. We are also building a more sustainable, predictable year-round business by featuring spring/summer footwear, slippers, apparel, accessories, and Men's UGG brand products in our retail stores, which better utilizes our existing infrastructure.

Marcato is calling for the rapid closure of most of our retail stores. After an extensive review, the Board and management team have concluded that this reckless approach would destroy a profitable revenue stream, damage the brand and saddle Deckers with substantial lease termination costs. Marcato's ill-advised plan would destroy stockholder value by significantly reducing near-term profitability and endangering longer-term growth potential. The Board thinks it is better to use our available cash for stock repurchases instead of drastically slashing stores, even profitable ones, and burning cash to do so.

Although we have demonstrated the power of our retail stores to increase the value of the UGG brand, we recognize that our work must continue, particularly around ensuring that our retail footprint delivers appropriate stockholder value as the industry continues to evolve. To that end, we are targeting a total of approximately 125 company-owned stores, down from 160 stores at the start of fiscal 2018.

Progress to Date in Reducing Costs

A key component of our transformation of Deckers is an intense focus on reducing costs. As our recent financial results demonstrate, we have made great progress over the past two years by: 


   -- Closing 25 underperforming stores; 
 
   -- Lowering retail infrastructure spend; 
 
   -- Divesting or shuttering underperforming brands in order to focus on our 
      core brands; and 
 
   -- Consolidating brand management and several offices. 

Our progress has been substantial. Deckers is a stronger, healthier and more focused company as a result of these efforts--and will be even more so in the future as we continue to execute on our robust transformation strategy.

Integrating the Retail and Ecommerce Experiences to Build Our Brands and Drive Sales

Under the transformation strategy, Deckers has launched key omni-channel initiatives such as Click & Collect, Infinite UGG and the UGG Rewards consumer loyalty program. These better integrate the retail store and ecommerce experiences and drive additional volume and user traffic. In particular, UGG Rewards engages our consumers and provides Deckers with a way to further build our ecosystem of consumer information. We believe that UGG Rewards will help drive greater DTC results by encouraging consumers to make additional purchases and enhancing our relationship with, and the lifetime value of, our consumers.

Improving Wholesale Distribution to Align with Our Consumers' Shopping Behavior

In addition, as part of our omni-channel strategy, we have streamlined our wholesale distribution. Our aim is to transform our account base to effectively align with the changes in consumer shopping behavior. In fiscal 2017, we closed accounts that did not represent the best of the brand and opened new accounts with wholesale partners who are committed to showcasing more of our offerings and have a strong online presence. In North America alone, we closed approximately 325 UGG accounts while incubating new opportunities with Macy's premium stores and Amazon.

A more streamlined wholesale channel strengthens our omni-channel presence because it allows our consumers to interact with a more consistent representation of the brand. We believe that our transformed omni-channel approach will help us further showcase our brands in a positive way and will facilitate improved marketplace interactions, allowing consumers to engage with the brand on their terms in a more focused and consistent manner.

$400 MILLION STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN REINFORCES THE BOARD'S CONFIDENCE IN OUR TRANSFORMATION STRATEGY

We recently announced a significant increase to our stock repurchase program, bringing our total repurchase authorization to $400 million. We expect to repurchase $400 million of stock by year-end fiscal 2020, and are targeting completion of approximately $100 million of stock repurchases prior to the end of March 2018.

The strength of our balance sheet, our ability to generate cash and our conviction in future prospects make this an ideal time to repurchase stock and return capital to stockholders. Repurchasing stock while continuing to improve our operating profit achieves two key objectives: it returns capital to all stockholders and it positions Deckers for sustainable, long-term growth.

DECKERS IS WELL-POSITIONED FOR THE FUTURE

We are confident in our future and have a well-developed, multi-faceted strategic plan with clear milestones ahead: 


   -- Improve operating margin to be over 10.5% in fiscal 2018. 
 
   -- Achieve an operating margin of at least 13% by the end of fiscal 2020, 
      which would move Deckers to be in the top quartile of the footwear 
      industry. 
 
   -- Implement a capital allocation framework that will drive an increased 
      return on invested capital.

Press Release: Deckers Brands Mails Letter to -2-

Our transformation is working. In the midst of one of the most challenging retail environments in history, Deckers has never been better positioned to grow stockholder value. We are streamlining our cost structure, optimizing our retail strategy, focusing on profitability as well as growth and executing the most significant stock repurchase program in our history. The Board is holding management fully accountable for delivering on our plan.

You play a key role in keeping our momentum going. Now is not the time to replace our Board of experienced and well-qualified directors with a slate of nominees hand-picked by an activist stockholder who does not understand our business or our strategy and who has short-term, nearsighted objectives.

Protect the value of your investment. Please vote ""FOR"" ALL nine of Deckers' highly qualified directors using the enclosed WHITE proxy card TODAY.

Thank you for your continued support.

Sincerely,

John M. Gibbons

Chairman of the Board

2017-11-02,DHI,Blue Apron Slides as Meal-Kit Competition Grows -- Market Talk,"1127 ET - Blue Apron posts a loss and shed customers in 3Q, straining to retain its edge in the saturated meal-kit market just months after an initial public offering. Shares fall to record lows after Blue Apron reported worse-than-expected earnings per share and partially lowered its guidance for the rest of the year. Blue Apron's profitability and customer count suffered from big decreases in advertising, and the company expects severance costs associated with recent layoffs to take a toll next quarter. The company also dropped plans to build a fulfillment center in California, focusing on one in New Jersey instead. Blue Apron is down 7.3% to $4.33.

1115 ET - House Republicans are expected to roll out a bill later today that slashes the corporate tax rate to 20% from the current 35%--something some investors and analysts believe will help juice corporate earnings growth and boost stocks. Yet some investors warn not to take the tax bill at face value. A tax plan that boosts economic growth and inflation could give the Federal Reserve a case to raise interest rates more quickly, says Charlie Diebel, head of rates at Aviva Investors , potentially upsetting the dynamic of low rates and steady growth that has helped stocks keep climbing for years. Major indexes are narrowly mixed. (akane.otani@wsj.com; @akaneotani)

1115 ET - Bunge says it's put in place severance agreements for some executive officers if the agricultural company is taken over, catching the eye of investors who've been wondering whether mining conglomerate Glencore might reapproach Bunge about a deal. Bunge disclosed the agreements, made on Wednesday, in a quarterly SEC filing late Wednesday: They provide two years' base salary and two times the annual target bonus if executives are let go by the company without cause or the executives leave ""for good reason"" before the second anniversary of a change of control for Bunge. Executives include Bunge's CFO and heads of its Brazil, agribusiness and food-products units. CEO Soren Schroder already had a change of control agreement. In the filing, Bunge says the move will ""enhance retention and align with market practice."" Bunge is up 0.7% to $70.06.(jacob.bunge@wsj.com; @jacobbunge)

1112 ET - Oilfield services firm Weatherford seems to be in perpetual comeback mode after settling bribery probes with the US Justice Department back in 2013, but the latest efforts might finally pay off. ""Re-Organized, Re-Aligned, Re-Structured, -- Really Positive,"" says Credit Suisse after Weatherford's earnings call and a $256M 3Q loss that many analysts say were nonetheless encouraging. Credit Suisse notes Weatherford's new CEO Mark McCollum laid out his new plan which included a complete restructuring of reporting, markets and product categories, and support structure, and even removes an entire layer of senior management. ""The restructuring should take $1B out of costs over the next 18-24 months,"" it says. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

1051 ET - Shares of homebuilders slide after details of the House Republicans' tax bill are released, with Lennar falling 3.1%, PulteGroup down 2.4%, DR Horton down 1.4% and KB Home off 3.6%. One theory that could explain the group's fall: the GOP bill is expected to limit the home mortgage-interest deduction, according to Mohit Bajaj, director of ETF trading solutions at WallachBeth Capital, meaning buyers would only be able to deduct interest on loans up to $500,000, down from $1M today. Real-estate brokers had lobbied against removing the deduction, which they see as an important incentive for homeownership. Still, Bajaj warns against taking too much stock in the day's moves, saying the ""knee-jerk reaction"" in the market is likely to moderate as more details come out.

1035 ET - Exports were a bright spot for Illinois-based fertilizer maker CF, which shipped record volumes in 3Q as international prices trumped those in North America. Strong fertilizer demand in India and Brazil benefited CF, as did slowing Chinese production and shipments. A big global appetite for nitrogen fertilizer came at the right time, CF executives said on an earnings call, as North American customers are dealing with price fluctuations by buying products as they need them and maintaining lower inventories. CF is hopeful environmental reforms in China will continue to curtail production there, keeping a lid on global competition as the company works through an ongoing supply glut next year.

Prospective customers can also use the app, says Steve Ellis, head of innovation, in an interview.

2017 OUTLOOK

The Company raised its full year 2017 GAAP revenue growth guidance range from 11.5% to 13.0% to a range of 15.0% to 15.5% over the prior year. The Company's previous 2017 GAAP revenue growth guidance range reflected an anticipated 1.0% unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, while the Company's revised 2017 GAAP revenue growth guidance range reflects an anticipated 0.75% favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, the Company raised its full year 2017 guidance range from 12.5% to 14.0% to a range of 14.25% to 14.75% over the prior year. The forecasted GAAP and constant currency revenue growth guidance reflect the impact of Vascular Solutions ' product sales, which are expected to contribute approximately 8.5%, as compared to our prior expectations of 8.5% to 9%, and the impact of NeoTract's product sales, which are expected to contribute approximately 1.5% to 1.7%.

The Company lowered its full year 2017 GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance from a range of $5.91 to $5.98 to a range of $5.61 to $5.66. The decrease in expected full year 2017 GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance from prior expectations is primarily due to anticipated costs associated with the acquisition of NeoTract. The Company raised its full year 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance from a range of $8.20 to $8.35 to a range of $8.30 to $8.40.

CONFERENCE CALL WEBCAST AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

As previously announced, Teleflex will comment on its financial results on a conference call to be held today at 8:00 a.m. (ET). The call will be available live and archived on the company's website at www.teleflex.com and the accompanying presentation will be posted prior to the call. An audio replay will be available until November 8, 2017 at 11:59pm (ET), by calling 855-859-2056 (U.S./Canada) or 404-537-3406 (International), Passcode: 3479079.

ADDITIONAL NOTES

References in this release to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on adjusted diluted earnings per share include both the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on foreign currency denominated transactions.

In the discussion of segment results, ""new products"" refers to products we have sold commercially within the past 36 months and ""existing products"" refers to products we have sold commercially for more than 36 months.

Certain financial information is presented on a rounded basis, which may cause minor differences.

Segment results and commentary exclude the impact of discontinued operations.

NOTES ON NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

We report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, commonly referred to as ""GAAP."" In this press release, we provide supplemental information, consisting of the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted diluted earnings per share and constant currency revenue growth. These non-GAAP measures are described in more detail below. Management uses these financial measures to assess Teleflex 's financial performance, make operating decisions, allocate financial resources, provide guidance on possible future results, and assist in its evaluation of period-to-period and peer comparisons. The non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors because they provide insight into management's assessment of our business, and provide supplemental information pertinent to a comparison of period-to-period results of our ongoing operations. The non-GAAP financial measures are presented in addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Moreover, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Tables reconciling historical GAAP diluted earnings per share to historical adjusted diluted earnings per share are set forth below. A table reconciling changes in historical GAAP net revenues to changes in historical constant currency net revenues is set forth above under ""Third Quarter Net Revenue by Segment"". Tables reconciling forecasted 2017 constant currency revenue growth and forecasted 2017 adjusted earnings per share to their respective most directly comparable forecasted GAAP measures, forecasted 2017 revenue growth and forecasted 2017 diluted earnings per share available to common stockholders, are set forth above under ""2017 Outlook"".

Adjusted diluted earnings per share: This non-GAAP measure is based upon diluted earnings per share available to common stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, adjusted to exclude, depending on the period presented, the impact (net of tax) of (i) restructuring, restructuring related and impairment items; (ii) acquisition, integration and divestiture related items; (iii) other items identified in note (C) to the reconciliation tables set forth below; (iv) amortization of debt discount on convertible notes; (v) intangible amortization expense; (vi) loss on extinguishment of debt and (vii) tax adjustments. Management does not believe that any of the excluded items are indicative of our underlying core performance or business trends.

In addition, the calculation of the weighted average number of diluted shares within adjusted earnings per share gives effect to the anti-dilutive impact of shares due to the Company under its previously outstanding convertible note hedge agreements. The convertible note hedge agreements reduced the potential economic dilution that otherwise would have occurred upon conversion of the Company's senior subordinated convertible notes (under GAAP, the anti-dilutive impact of the convertible note hedge agreements was not reflected in the weighted average number of diluted shares). We believe that an adjustment to show the anti-dilutive effect of the convertible note hedge agreements provides supplemental information that can be useful to investors in assessing the computation of diluted earnings per share.

Constant currency revenue growth: This non-GAAP measure is based upon net revenues, adjusted to eliminate the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from period to period. The impact of changes in foreign currency may vary significantly from period to period, and generally are outside of the control of our management. We believe that this measure facilitates a comparison of our operating performance exclusive of fluctuations that do not reflect our underlying performance or business trends. 


 
 
RECONCILIATION OF CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME ITEMS 
Dollars in millions, except per share amounts 
 
The following reconciliation tables reflect a change in the classification of 
certain adjustment items from those presented in reconciliation tables 
included in our previous earnings releases. Specifically, we created a new 
line item titled ""acquisition, integration and divestiture related items."" The 
components of this new line item were formerly included in ""losses and other 
charges, net."" Additionally, we have included a new line item titled 
""restructuring, restructuring related and impairment items,"" which combines 
restructuring related items, which previously were included in ""losses and 
other charges, net,"" with restructuring charges and other impairment items, 
which previously were included in ""restructuring and other impairment 
charges."" The prior periods presented in the following reconciliation tables 
and related materials were reclassified to conform to the current 
presentation.

(A) Restructuring, restructuring related and impairment items - Restructuring programs involve discrete initiatives designed to, among other things, consolidate or relocate manufacturing, administrative and other facilities, improve operating efficiencies and integrate acquired businesses. Our restructuring charges consist of termination benefits, contract termination costs, facility closure costs and other exit costs associated with a specific restructuring program. Restructuring related charges are directly related to our restructuring programs and consist of facility consolidation costs, including accelerated depreciation expense related to facility closures, costs to transfer manufacturing operations between locations, and retention bonuses offered to certain employees as an incentive for them to remain with our company after completion of the restructuring program. For the three months ended October 1, 2017 and September 25, 2016, pre-tax restructuring related charges were $3.1 million and $4.4 million, respectively.

(B) Acquisition, integration and divestiture related items - Acquisition and integration expenses are incremental costs, other than restructuring or restructuring related expenses, that are directly related to specific business or asset acquisition transactions. These costs may include, among other things, professional, consulting and other fees; systems integration costs; legal entity restructuring expense; inventory step-up amortization (amortization, through cost of goods sold, of the increase in fair value of inventory resulting from a fair value calculation as of the acquisition date); fair value adjustments to contingent consideration; and bridge loan facility and backstop financing fees in connection with facilities that ultimately were not utilized. For the three months ended October 1, 2017, the majority of these costs were related to our acquisition of Vascular Solutions . Divestiture related activities involve specific business or asset sales. Depending primarily on the terms of the divestiture transaction, the carrying value of the divested business or assets on our financial statements and other costs we incur as a direct result of the divestiture transaction, we may recognize a gain or loss in connection with the divestiture related activities.

(C) Other items - These are discrete items that occur sporadically and can affect period-to-period comparisons. For the three months ended October 1, 2017, these items included both gains and losses associated with litigation settlements.

(D) Amortization of debt discount on convertible notes - When we sold $400 million principal amount of our 3.875% convertible notes (the ""convertible notes"") in 2010, we allocated the proceeds between the liability and equity components of the debt, in accordance with GAAP. As a result, the $83.7 million difference between the proceeds of the sale of the convertible notes and the liability component of the debt constituted a debt discount that was to be amortized to interest expense over the approximately seven year term of the convertible notes, which significantly increased the amount we recorded as interest expense attributable to the convertible notes. The amount of the amortization of the debt discount was reduced as a result of our repurchases of convertible notes in 2016 and 2017 and redemptions of the convertible notes by holders of the notes, although we continued to amortize the remaining portion of the debt discount to interest expense until August 2017, when all remaining convertible notes were either converted or matured.

(E) Intangible amortization expense - Certain intangible assets, including customer lists, intellectual property, distribution rights, trade names and non-competition agreements, initially are recorded at historical cost and then amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. The amount of such amortization can vary from period to period as a result of, among other things, business or asset acquisitions or dispositions.

(F) Loss on extinguishment of debt - In connection with debt refinancings, debt repayments, repurchases of convertible notes and redemptions of convertible notes, outstanding indebtedness is extinguished. These events, which have occurred from time to time on an irregular basis, have resulted in losses reflecting, among other things, unamortized debt issuance costs, as well as debt prepayment fees and premiums (including conversion premiums resulting from conversion of convertible securities).

(G) Tax adjustments - These adjustments represent the impact of the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations for prior year returns, the resolution of audits, the filing of amended returns with respect to prior tax years and/or tax law changes affecting our deferred tax liability.

(H) Adjusted diluted shares are calculated by giving effect to the anti-dilutive impact of the Company's convertible note hedge agreements, which reduced the potential economic dilution that otherwise would have occurred upon conversion of the Company's convertible notes. Under GAAP, the anti-dilutive impact of the convertible note hedge agreements is not reflected in the weighted average number of diluted shares. 


 
 
RECONCILIATION OF CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME ITEMS 
Dollars in millions, except per share amounts 
 
The following reconciliation tables reflect a change in the classification of 
certain adjustment items from those presented in reconciliation tables 
included in our previous earnings releases. Specifically, we created a new 
line item titled ""acquisition, integration and divestiture related items."" The 
components of this new line item were formerly included in ""losses and other 
charges, net."" Additionally, we have included a new line item titled 
""restructuring, restructuring related and impairment items,"" which combines 
restructuring related items, which previously were included in ""losses and 
other charges, net,"" with restructuring charges and other impairment items, 
which previously were included in ""restructuring and other impairment 
charges."" The prior periods presented in the following reconciliation tables 
and related materials were reclassified to conform to the current 
presentation.

(A) Restructuring, restructuring related and impairment items - Restructuring programs involve discrete initiatives designed to, among other things, consolidate or relocate manufacturing, administrative and other facilities, improve operating efficiencies and integrate acquired businesses. Our restructuring charges consist of termination benefits, contract termination costs, facility closure costs and other exit costs associated with a specific restructuring program. Restructuring related charges are directly related to our restructuring programs and consist of facility consolidation costs, including accelerated depreciation expense related to facility closures, costs to transfer manufacturing operations between locations, and retention bonuses offered to certain employees as an incentive for them to remain with our company after completion of the restructuring program. For the nine months ended October 1, 2017 and September 25, 2016, pre-tax restructuring related charges were $10.1 million and $11.1 million.

Depending primarily on the terms of the divestiture transaction, the carrying value of the divested business or assets on our financial statements and other costs we incur as a direct result of the divestiture transaction, we may recognize a gain or loss in connection with the divestiture related activities.

This press release contains forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the impact of the NeoTract acquisition and revenue and non-revenue dependent opportunities, forecasted 2017 GAAP and constant currency revenue growth and GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Actual results could differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements due to, among other things, changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers or suppliers; delays or cancellations in shipments; demand for and market acceptance of new and existing products; our inability to integrate acquired businesses into our operations, realize planned synergies and operate such businesses profitably in accordance with our expectations; the inability of acquired businesses to generate revenues in accordance with our expectations; our inability to effectively execute our restructuring programs; our inability to realize anticipated savings from restructuring plans and programs; the impact of healthcare reform legislation and proposals to amend the legislation; changes in Medicare, Medicaid and third party coverage and reimbursements; competitive market conditions and resulting effects on revenues and pricing; increases in raw material costs that cannot be recovered in product pricing; global economic factors, including currency exchange rates, interest rates, sovereign debt issues and the impact of the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union ; difficulties in entering new markets; general economic conditions; and other factors described or incorporated in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission , including our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.

3. What drove the fluctuation in the effective tax rate?

Our effective income tax rate was 26.1% and 29.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, respectively. The decrease in our effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to the adoption of the new stock-based compensation guidance we prospectively adopted in the first quarter of 2017 that requires the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. These amounts were previously recognized in additional paid-in-capital. We recognized a $4.8 million tax benefit related to the accounting change in the third quarter of 2017.

4. What is the breakdown of costs related to the cybersecurity incident?

During the third quarter of 2017, we recorded $87.5 million ($59.3 million, net of tax) for expenses related to the cybersecurity incident announced September 7, 2017. The components of the costs are as follows: 


 
                     Three Months Ended 
(In millions)         September 30, 2017 
Product cost         $                55.5 
Professional fees    17.1 
Consumer support     14.9 
Total                $                 87.5 
 

Expenses Incurred. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company recorded $27.3 million of pretax expenses related to the cybersecurity incident. These expenses are included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017. Expenses include costs to investigate and remediate the cybersecurity incident and legal and other professional services related thereto, all of which were expensed as incurred.

Contingent Liability. Additionally, as a result of the cybersecurity incident, we are offering free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection to all U.S. consumers. We have concluded that the costs associated with providing this service are a contingent liability that is probable and estimable. We have therefore recorded an estimate of the expenses necessary to provide this service to those who have signed up or will sign up by the January 31, 2018 deadline. We have incurred $4.7 million through September 30, 2017 and have estimated a range of additional costs between $56 million and $110 million. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification section 450-20-30-1, we have recorded a liability for the low end in the range as we do not believe that any amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.

(1) During the third quarter of 2017, we recorded acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $43.0 million ($35.1 million, net of tax). We calculate this financial measure by excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and including a benefit to reflect the significant cash income tax savings resulting from the income tax deductibility of amortization for certain acquired intangibles. The $7.9 million of tax is comprised of $14.1 million of tax expense net of $6.2 million of a cash income tax benefit. During the third quarter of 2016, we recorded acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $47.5 million ($38.0 million, net of tax). The $9.5 million of tax is comprised of $15.7 million of tax expense net of $6.2 million of a cash income tax benefit.

(2) During the third quarter of 2016, we recorded $6.3 million ($4.4 million, net of tax) for Veda acquisition related amounts other than acquisition-related amortization related to transaction and integration costs in operating income. See the Notes to this reconciliation for additional detail.

(3) During the third quarter of 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $4.8 million related to the tax effects of deductions for stock compensation in excess of amounts recorded for compensation costs. See the Notes to this reconciliation for additional detail.

(4) During the third quarter of 2017, we recorded $87.5 million ($59.3 million, net of tax) for expenses related to the cybersecurity incident. See the Notes to this reconciliation for additional detail.

(5) During the third quarter of 2017, we recorded the tax impact of adjustments of $36.1 million comprised of (i) acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $7.9 million ($14.1 million of tax expense net of $6.2 million of cash income tax benefit) and (ii) a tax adjustment of $28.2 million related to expenses for the cybersecurity incident.

During the third quarter of 2016 we recorded the tax impact of adjustments of $11.4 million comprised of (i) acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $9.5 million ($15.7 million of tax expense net of $6.2 million of cash income tax benefit), and (ii) a tax adjustment of $1.9 million for Veda acquisition related amounts other than acquisition related amortization.

(1) During the third quarter of 2017, we recorded $87.5 million ($59.3 million, net of tax) for expenses related to the cybersecurity incident. See the Notes to this reconciliation for additional detail.

During the third quarter of 2016, we recorded $6.3 million ($4.4 million, net of tax) for Veda acquisition related amounts other than acquisition-related amortization related to transaction and integration costs in operating income. See the Notes to this reconciliation for additional detail.

Notes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Comparable GAAP Financial Measures

Diluted EPS attributable to Equifax is adjusted for the following items:

Acquisition-related amortization expense - We calculate this financial measure by excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and including a benefit to reflect the material cash income tax savings resulting from the income tax deductibility of amortization for certain acquired intangibles. These financial measures are not prepared in conformity with GAAP. Management believes excluding the impact of amortization expense is useful because excluding acquisition-related amortization, and other items that are not comparable, allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Certain acquired intangibles result in material cash income tax savings which are not reflected in earnings. Management believes that including a benefit to reflect the cash income tax savings is useful as it allows investors to better value Equifax . Management makes these adjustments to earnings when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital.

Veda acquisition related amounts for transaction and due diligence expenses incurred as a direct result of the acquisition, as well as integration expense in the first year following the closure of the acquisition - During the third quarter of 2017, we did not exclude any amounts related to the Veda acquisition transaction charges. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Management makes these adjustments to net income when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax 's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Income tax effects of stock awards that are recognized upon vesting or settlement - During the third quarter of 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $4.8 million related to the tax effects of deductions in excess of compensation costs in accordance with newly adopted guidance. Management believes excluding this tax effect from financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, because this amount is non-operating and relates to income tax benefits or deficiencies for stock awards recognized when tax amounts differ from recognized stock compensation cost. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax 's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Accrual for costs related to the cybersecurity incident - During the third quarter of 2017, we reported that we were the target of a cybersecurity incident impacting approximately 145.5 million U.S. consumers. We recorded $87.5 million ($59.3 million, net of tax) during the third quarter of 2017 associated with the costs to investigate the cybersecurity incident, legal fees to respond to subsequent litigation and costs to deliver the free product offering made to all U.S. consumers. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Management makes these adjustments to net income when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax 's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin - Management defines adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income attributable to Equifax plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and also excludes certain one-time items. Management believes the use of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis.

Shares of Cavium climbed 8.4% to $82.18 premarket after news hit that Marvell Technology Group plans to acquire the chip maker in a roughly $6 billion deal that values Cavium at about $80 per share. Marvell shares were up 2.8% premarket.","GE shares fell 0.3% premarket after The Wall Street Journal reported that a housecleaning at the industrial conglomerate's board will remove many long-term associates of former Chief Executive Jeff Immelt and aims to create a board that is more closely aligned with CEO John Flannery's vision.

Shares of Verizon Communications rose 1% before the opening bell following a Wells Fargo analyst upgrade to outperform from market perform. Wells Fargo also raised its price target on shares of the wireless carrier to $50 from $48. The stock closed at $45.42 Friday. Additionally, Bloomberg reported that the firm is close to a new deal with the National Football League for digital streaming rights of game broadcasts.

PayPal Holdings shares were up 0.8% premarket. The payments giant said it is connecting its website and smartphone apps with those of Acorns Grow Inc., a five-year-old automated savings and investment service, in a move into robo-investing.

Shares of Wal-Mart Stores declined 1.1% premarket after e-commerce giant Alibaba said it will pay $2.88 billion for a 36% stake in China's second-largest big-box retailer, Sun Art Retail Group, one of Wal-Mart's rivals in the country. Additionally, Goldman Sachs downgraded Wal-Mart to neutral from buy.

Blue Apron Holdings Inc. shares rose 1% premarket after KeyBanc Capital Markets initiated coverage on the meal kit delivery firm with a sector perform rating.

Shares of Amazon.com Inc. climbed 0.2% before the opening bell following an Instinet price target increase to $1,360, the highest of roughly 45 analysts tracked by FactSet. Shares closed at $1,129.88 Friday and would need to gain 20% to hit Instinet's price target.

Qualcomm Inc. shares advanced 0.5% premarket after Reuters reported that the chip maker is set to win Japanese antitrust clearance for its $38-billion bid for NXP Semiconductors and gain Europe's approval by the end of the year.

Time Warner Inc. shares were little changed premarket. ""Justice League,"" a Warner Bros.' megabudget production, opened to an estimated $96 million in the U.S. and Canada this weekend. The Time Warner Inc.-owned studio spent nearly $300 million to make the movie. Though not a flop, that is well below the studio's hopes and less than any DC superhero movie since the 2011 flop ""Green Lantern.""

Shares of Acorda Therapeutics Inc. fell 1.7% before the opening bell after the firm said it is discontinuing studies of its Parkinson's disease treatment tozadenant.

Cardinal Health Inc. shares declined 3.7% premarket following a Morgan Stanley analyst downgrade to underweight from equal weight.

Once scoffed at by the bigger players on Wall Street, investors are now seeing big names and big money get on the bitcoin train.

Big money is flowing into the sector with HIVE Blockchain announcing closing ""$34.5 Million Bought Deal Financing and Expands Production of Newly Minted Digital Currencies."" The net proceeds of the Offering are to be used to fund the second phase of construction at the digital currency mining data centre in Sweden.

tZERO announced that the company's token sale, utilizing a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (or SAFT), will begin on December 18, 2017. ""The interest in the proposed tZERO token sale has been overwhelming, and we have been working with our advisors to create the most unique and innovative token,"" said Joseph Cammarata, President of tZERO. Patrick Byrne , CEO of Overstock.com and Founder of tÃ said earlier at Money20/20, ""We think this may be the largest ICO yet that comes to market.""

Square's stock ran last week and also boosted bitcoin prices close to $8000 on news that they will be running a trial for some users of its Cash platform to buy and sell bitcoin.

""Given SQ's tendency to move judiciously into new technologies, we expect it will do the same with bitcoin purchases. We believe the largest risk is regulation, which could limit its ability to provide the service or outright ban it. SQ is also exposed to liquidity and counterparty risk as it must source bitcoin for users either by pre-buying or using an exchange. Despite these risks, the upside could be significant if cryptocurrencies become more mainstream.""

On October 31(st) CME Group , the world's leading and most diverse derivatives marketplace, announced it intends to launch bitcoin futures in the fourth quarter of 2017, pending all relevant regulatory review periods.

""Given increasing client interest in the evolving cryptocurrency markets, we have decided to introduce a bitcoin futures contract,"" said Terry Duffy, CME Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""As the world's largest regulated FX marketplace, CME Group is the natural home for this new vehicle that will provide investors with transparency, price discovery and risk transfer capabilities.""

In the press release Merrick Okamoto , Chairman of Marathon said, ""This acquisition provides investors an opportunity to invest in one of the first NASDAQ-listed public companies to enter this rapidly growing industry.""

On November 13(th) , Reality Shares and Nasdaq announced the creation of the Reality Shares Nasdaq Blockchain Economy Index, a smart-beta index that tracks the growth and development of leading global companies creating and implementing blockchain solutions.

""Reality Shares recognized the tremendous growth potential of blockchain technology and subsequently teamed up with Nasdaq to identify what we believe to be the leading global companies deploying resources to develop blockchain applications,"" said Eric Ervin, CEO of Reality Shares. ""As these new applications are deployed, we believe these companies will most likely become disrupters in their industries, with potential to profit at the expense of laggard companies that do not deploy blockchain applications.""

      trade analytics tools are highly aligned

      and fix times from hours to minutes 
 
   -- Simple set-up and configuration with pre-programmed exchange feeds

FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 14, 2017-- 

The TJX Companies, Inc . (NYSE: TJX), the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide, today announced sales and earnings results for the third quarter ended October 28, 2017. Net sales for the third quarter of Fiscal 2018 increased 6% to $8.8 billion and consolidated comparable store sales were flat compared to last year's 5% increase. Net income for the third quarter was $641 million. Diluted earnings per share were $1.00, a 20% increase over the prior year's GAAP EPS of $.83 and a 10% increase over the prior year's adjusted EPS of $.91, which excludes the combined $.08 impact of last year's debt extinguishment charge and pension settlement charge.

For the first nine months of Fiscal 2018, net sales were $24.9 billion, a 5% increase over last year's 8% increase. Consolidated comparable store sales increased 1% over last year's 5% increase. Net income for the first nine months of Fiscal 2018 was $1.7 billion and diluted earnings per share were $2.67, a 10% increase over the prior year's GAAP EPS of $2.43 and a 6% increase over the prior year's adjusted EPS of $2.51.

Ernie Herrman , Chief Executive Officer and President of The TJX Companies, Inc., stated, ""For the third quarter, consolidated comparable store sales were flat versus last year's strong 5% increase. Earnings per share were $1.00, which was at the high end of our plan. Certainly, the hurricanes had a negative impact during the quarter. Our greatest concern is the well-being of our Associates, their families, our customers and everyone affected by these natural disasters, and our hearts go out to the people who have been impacted. Additionally, we believe that warmer temperatures in the U.S. during the quarter dampened demand for apparel at our Marmaxx division. While sales were not as strong as we would have liked, we were pleased that sales trends at Marmaxx improved as the weather turned more seasonable. Further, customer traffic, or transactions, were strong and up at every major division. Importantly, our consolidated merchandise margin increased, which we believe speaks to the flexibility of our off-price business model. Overall, our organization sharply executed our off-price fundamentals of opportunistic buying, lean inventory discipline, and being strategic and targeted in the flow of merchandise to our stores, which helped drive margins.

""Looking ahead, the fourth quarter is off to a strong start and we see numerous opportunities for the holiday selling season across our retail banners. We have excellent inventory liquidity to capitalize on the plentiful opportunities we are seeing for quality, branded merchandise in the marketplace. We will be offering consumers eclectic gift selections from around the world, at compelling, off-price values, and shipping fresh assortments to our stores and online throughout December and beyond. We have many initiatives underway to drive sales and traffic and are excited about our marketing campaigns. We are confident that we will achieve our goals for 2017 and as always, we will strive to surpass them. We have enormous confidence in the continued, successful growth of TJX !""

Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect the translation of sales and earnings of the Company's international businesses into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. In addition, ordinary course, inventory-related hedging instruments are marked to market at the end of each quarter. Changes in currency exchange rates can have a material effect on the magnitude of these translations and adjustments when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates.

For the third quarter of Fiscal 2018, the movement in foreign currency exchange rates had a one percentage point positive impact on consolidated net sales growth. The overall net impact of foreign currency exchange rates had a $.04 positive impact on third quarter Fiscal 2018 earnings per share, compared with a neutral impact last year.

For the first nine months of Fiscal 2018, the movement in foreign currency exchange rates had a neutral impact on consolidated net sales growth. The overall net impact of foreign currency exchange rates had a $.01 positive impact on earnings per share in the first nine months of Fiscal 2018, compared with a $.01 negative impact last year.

A table detailing the impact of foreign currency on TJX pretax earnings and margins, as well as those of its international businesses, can be found in the Investors section of tjx.com.

The foreign currency exchange rate impact to earnings per share does not include the impact currency exchange rates have on various transactions, which we refer to as ""transactional foreign exchange.""

Margins

For the third quarter of Fiscal 2018, the Company's consolidated pretax profit margin was 11.6%. This was a 0.9 percentage point increase compared with the prior year's 10.7% margin and down 0.1 percentage point compared with the prior year's adjusted 11.7% margin, which excluded a debt extinguishment charge and pension settlement charge.

Gross profit margin for the third quarter of Fiscal 2018 was 29.8%, up 0.3 percentage points versus the prior year. This was due to gains related to the Company's inventory hedges as well as an increase in merchandise margin, partially offset by higher supply chain costs and expense deleverage on the flat consolidated comparable store sales.

Selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales were 18.1%, up 0.5 percentage points versus the prior year's ratio, primarily due to expenses from hurricanes and wage increases.

Inventory

Total inventories as of October 28, 2017, were $4.7 billion, compared with $4.4 billion at the end of the third quarter last year. Consolidated inventories on a per-store basis as of October 28, 2017, including the distribution centers, but excluding inventory in transit and the Company's e-commerce businesses, were down 2% on a reported basis and down 4% on a constant currency basis. The Company enters the fourth quarter in an excellent inventory position, and has plenty of liquidity to take advantage of the plentiful buying opportunities in the marketplace and ship constantly changing gift assortments to its stores throughout the holiday season.

Shareholder Distributions

During the third quarter, the Company repurchased a total of $350 million of TJX stock, retiring 4.9 million shares. During the first nine months of the year, the Company repurchased a total of $1.25 billion of TJX stock, retiring 16.9 million shares. The Company continues to expect to repurchase approximately $1.5 to $1.8 billion of TJX stock in Fiscal 2018. The Company may adjust this amount up or down depending on various factors. Through its dividend program, under which the current per share dividend represents a 20% increase versus last year, the Company returned to shareholders $197 million in the third quarter and $567 million in the first nine months of the year.

Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2018 Outlook

14 Nov 2017 08:35 ET 
Press Release: The TJX Companies, Inc . Reports Q3 -2-

For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, the Company expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.27, a 21% to 23% increase over the prior year's EPS of $1.03. Excluding an approximate $.11 benefit from the extra week in the fourth quarter, the Company expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.14 to $1.16, an 11% to 13% increase over the prior year. This guidance reflects an assumption that wage increases will negatively impact EPS growth by 1%. The Company also anticipates that the combination of foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange will positively impact EPS growth by 1%. This EPS outlook is based upon estimated consolidated comparable store sales growth of 1% to 2%.

For the 53-week fiscal year ending February 3, 2018, the Company is maintaining the high end of its earnings per share guidance. The Company expects diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.91 to $3.93. This represents a 13% to 14% increase over the prior year's EPS of $3.46. The Company's full-year guidance includes an expected benefit of approximately $.11 per share from the 53(rd) week in the Company's Fiscal 2018 calendar. Excluding this benefit, the Company expects adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.80 to $3.82. This would represent an 8% increase over the prior year's adjusted EPS of $3.53, which excludes the combined $.07 impact of last year's debt extinguishment and pension settlement charges from GAAP EPS of $3.46. This guidance reflects an assumption that wage increases will negatively impact EPS growth by 2%. The Company also anticipates that the combination of foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange will positively impact EPS growth by 1% and that the change in accounting rules for share-based compensation will positively impact EPS growth by 1%. This EPS outlook is based upon estimated consolidated comparable store sales growth of 1% to 2%.

The Company's earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and full year Fiscal 2018 assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the fourth quarter.

Stores by Concept

During the third quarter ended October 28, 2017, the Company increased its store count by 139 stores to a total of 4,052 stores. The Company increased square footage by 5% over the same period last year.

The TJX Companies, Inc . and Consolidated Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Condensed Statements

1. During the third quarter ended October 28, 2017, TJX repurchased 4.9 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $350 million. For the nine months ended October 28, 2017, TJX repurchased 16.9 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $1.25 billion. In February 2017, the Company announced that the Board of Directors approved an additional $1 billion stock repurchase program. TJX records the repurchase of its stock on a cash basis, and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above amounts due to the timing of settlement of repurchases.

2. On September 7, 2016 TJX issued $1.0 billion of 2.250% ten year notes. The Company used a portion of the proceeds to redeem its $375 million 6.950% notes prior to their scheduled maturity of April 15, 2019. On October 12, 2016 the Company completed the redemption of these notes and recorded a pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $51.8 million.

In addition, during the third quarter ended October 29, 2016 TJX offered eligible, former TJX Associates, who had not yet commenced receiving their pension benefit, an opportunity to receive a lump sum payout of their vested pension benefit. On October 21, 2016 the Company's pension plan paid $103.7 million from pension plan assets to those who accepted this offer, thereby reducing its pension benefit obligations. The transaction had no cash impact on TJX but did result in a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement charge of $31.2 million.

The company has presented non-GAAP measures in this earnings release excluding the impact of these two third quarter charges.

PR Newswire

AUBURN HILLS, Mich., Nov. 14, 2017

AUBURN HILLS, Mich., Nov. 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- BorgWarner 's new, world's first regulated two-stage (R2S(R) ) turbocharging system with four turbochargers for passenger cars debuts in the BMW Group 's latest TwinPower Turbo diesel engine, available for different high-performance models. While a conventional R2S system features one turbocharger for the low- and high-pressure stage respectively, this unique application utilizes two turbochargers for each stage. It thus provides higher efficiency, which contributes to constant and fluid power delivery over the entire rev band, and helps improve fuel efficiency up to 4 percent compared with the engine's predecessor.

""BorgWarner 's latest and most sophisticated R2S system features four turbochargers to take boosting to a whole new level and help our customer achieve the highest demands for power and efficiency for an exciting driving experience,"" said FrÃ©dÃ©ric Lissalde , President and General Manager, BorgWarner Turbo Systems. ""We introduced our R2S turbocharging solution into the passenger car market in cooperation with the BMW Group and are pleased to take the next step together. This prestigious project helps reinforce our position as a market leader in turbocharging technologies.""

Featuring four turbochargers, BorgWarner 's advanced two-stage turbocharging system boosts the new 3.0-liter 6-cylinder inline diesel engine to achieve a power output of 294 kW (394 HP ) and a maximum torque of 760 Nm. To meet these high requirements and provide outstanding performance, BorgWarner replaced the low-pressure turbocharger with two smaller ones to reduce inertia for faster response without increasing system weight. At low engine speeds, one high-pressure turbocharger quickly generates boost pressure for rapid acceleration without any noticeable turbo lag. At higher flow rates, both high-pressure turbines operate to increase the capacity.

Assets Are Acquired","From Principal Unit

Blackstone Group LP purchased a 4 million-square-foot portfolio of warehouses, distribution centers and other industrial property in a $500 million deal that shows that the love affair between the private-equity giant and the hot logistics sector continues, people familiar with the matter said.

Blackstone purchased the property in Southern California from Principal Real Estate Investors, the real-estate investment arm of Des Moines-based Principal Financial Group, people said.

Blackstone has been a major player in the logistics center since the early years of the post-2008 recovery, amassing huge portfolios of property in Europe and the U.S. Values of distribution centers and warehouses have been rising steadily as the economy strengthened and demand has increased from e-commerce companies.

No deal is imminent, but Art Coppola, chief executive officer at Macerich, said during the third-quarter earnings call Tuesday that the company has received interest from a number of possible buyers.

Mr. Coppola predicted Macerich will no longer own the asset within a year.

BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 01, 2017-- 

Boston Properties, Inc . (NYSE: BXP), a real estate investment trust and one of the largest owners, managers and developers of Class A office properties in the United States, reported results today for the third quarter ended September 30, 2017. 


   -- Net income attributable to common shareholders was $117.3 million 
      compared to $76.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 
 
   -- Net income attributable to common shareholders per share (EPS) was $0.76 
      basic and $0.76 on a diluted basis, compared to $0.50 basic and $0.50 on 
      a diluted basis for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 
 
   -- Funds from Operations (FFO) were $243.0 million, or $1.57 per share basic 
      and $1.57 per share diluted. This compares to FFO of $219.6 million, or 
      $1.43 per share basic and $1.42 per share diluted, for the quarter ended 
      September 30, 2016. 
   -- FFO of $1.57 per share diluted was greater than the mid-point of the 
      Company's guidance previously provided of $1.52 - $1.54 per share diluted 
      primarily due to: 
   -- $0.02 per share of additional development and management services 
      revenue; 
 
   -- $0.01 per share due to better than expected portfolio operations; and 
 
   -- $0.01 per share of less than projected general and administrative 
      expenses. 
   -- The Company provided its guidance for full year 2018 EPS and FFO per 
      share as follows: 
   -- Projected EPS (diluted) for 2018 of $2.55 - $2.71 per share; and 
 
   -- Projected FFO per share (diluted) for 2018 of $6.20 - $6.36 per share. 
   -- Development Highlights - Signed leases and commenced development of the 
      new office headquarters for Marriott International, Inc . and the 
      Transportation Security Administration  (""TSA"") aggregating 1.4 million 
      square feet, and fully placed in-service 888 Boylston Street, a 417,000 
      square foot office building development that is 93% leased. 

The reported results are unaudited and there can be no assurance that these reported results will not vary from the final information for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. In the opinion of management, the Company has made all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of these reported results.

At September 30, 2017, the Company's portfolio consisted of 177 properties aggregating approximately 49.8 million square feet, including ten properties under construction/redevelopment totaling approximately 5.7 million square feet. The overall percentage of leased space for the 164 properties in service (excluding the Company's two residential properties and hotel) as of September 30, 2017 was 90.2%.

Significant events during the third quarter included:

      Bernstein Companies to develop an approximately 722,000 net rentable 
      square foot (subject to adjustment based on finalized building design) 
      build-to-suit Class A office building and below-grade parking garage at 
      7750 Wisconsin Avenue in Bethesda, Maryland. The joint venture entered 
      into a lease agreement with an affiliate of Marriott International, Inc ., 
      under which Marriott will lease 100% of the office building and garage 
      for a term of 20 years, and the building will serve as Marriott's new 
      worldwide headquarters. Marriott has agreed to fund 100% of the related 
      tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions for the office building. 
      The Company will serve as co-development manager for the venture and 
      expects to commence construction in 2018. The Company and The Bernstein 
      Companies each own a 50% interest in the joint venture. 
 
   -- On August 24, 2017, the Company entered into a 15-year lease with the 
      General Services Administration , under which the Company will develop the 
      new headquarters for the TSA. The TSA will occupy 100% of the 
      approximately 623,000 net rentable square feet of Class A office space 
      and a parking garage at 6595 Springfield Center Drive located in 
      Springfield, Virginia. Concurrently with the execution of the lease, the 
      Company commenced development of the project and expects the building to 
      be available for occupancy by the fourth quarter of 2020. 
 
   -- On September 16, 2017, the Company completed and fully placed in-service 
      888 Boylston Street, a Class A office and retail project with 
      approximately 417,000 net rentable square feet located in Boston, 
      Massachusetts. The property is 93% leased. 

Acquisition and disposition activities 


   -- On August 30, 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Reston Eastgate 
      property located in Reston, Virginia for a gross sale price of $14.0 
      million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $13.2 million, resulting 
      in a gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $2.8 million. 
      Reston Eastgate is a parcel of land containing approximately 21.7 acres 
      located at 11011 Sunset Hills Road. 

Capital markets activities 


   -- On July 28, 2017, a joint venture in which the Company has a 50% interest 
      obtained mortgage financing collateralized by its Colorado Center 
      property located in Santa Monica, California totaling $550.0 million. The 
      mortgage financing bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.56% per annum and 
      matures on August 9, 2027. The loan requires interest-only payments 
      during the 10-year term of the loan, with the entire principal amount due 
      at maturity. The joint venture distributed $502.0 million to the partners, 
      of which the Company's share was $251.0 million. Colorado Center is a 
      six-building office complex that sits on a 15-acre site and contains an 
      aggregate of approximately 1,118,000 net rentable square feet with an 
      underground parking garage for 3,100 vehicles. 
 
   -- On September 6, 2017, a joint venture in which the Company has a 50% 
      interest obtained construction financing with a total commitment of 
      $204.6 million collateralized by its Hub on Causeway development project. 
      The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to 
      LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum and matures on September 6, 2021, with two, 
      one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions. As of 
      September 30, 2017, the venture had not drawn any funds under the loan. 
      The Hub on Causeway is an approximately 385,000 net rentable square foot 
      project containing retail and office space located in Boston, 
      Massachusetts. 

EPS and FFO per Share Guidance:

The Company's guidance for the fourth quarter 2017, full year 2017 and full year 2018 for EPS (diluted) and FFO per share (diluted) is set forth and reconciled below. Except as described below, the estimates reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including assumptions with respect to rental rates, occupancy levels and the earnings impact of the events referenced in this release and otherwise referenced during the conference call referred to below. The estimates do not include possible future gains or losses or the impact on operating results from other possible future property acquisitions or dispositions, other possible capital markets activity or possible future impairment charges. EPS estimates may be subject to fluctuations as a result of several factors, including changes in the recognition of depreciation and amortization expense and any gains or losses associated with disposition activity. The Company is not able to assess at this time the potential impact of these factors on projected EPS. By definition, FFO does not include real estate-related depreciation and amortization, impairment losses on depreciable real estate or gains or losses associated with disposition activities. There can be no assurance that the Company's actual results will not differ materially from the estimates set forth below.

As set forth below, the Company has updated its projected EPS (diluted) for the full year 2017 to $2.80 - $2.81 per share from $2.72 - $2.77 per share. This is an increase of approximately $0.06 per share at the mid-point of the Company's guidance consisting of $0.02 per share of better than expected portfolio performance and additional development services revenue, $0.02 per share of lower depreciation and amortization expense, and $0.02 per share resulting from an unbudgeted land sale during the third quarter of 2017. In addition, the Company has updated its projected guidance for FFO per share (diluted) for the full year to $6.24 - $6.25 per share from $6.20 - $6.25 per share. This is an increase of approximately $0.02 per share at the mid-point of the Company's guidance primarily consisting of better than expected portfolio performance and additional development services revenue.

Press Release: Boston Properties  Announces Third -2-

The Company's guidance for the full year 2018 for EPS (diluted) and FFO per share (diluted) is set forth and reconciled below. When compared to the full year 2017, the estimates for 2018 include, among other assumptions, (1) an incremental contribution of $0.26 per share at the mid-point from development deliveries and (2) an increase in the Company's Share of Same Property net operating income (""NOI"") (excluding termination income) of 0.5% to 2.5% resulting in an incremental $0.13 per share at the mid-point of the range. These items are partially offset by (1) an increase in net interest expense (including the Company's share of unconsolidated joint venture debt at Colorado Center) of $0.17 per share at the mid-point, (2) a decrease in lease termination fees of $0.10 per share at the mid-point, (3) an increase in depreciation expense primarily due to development deliveries of $0.07 per share, (4) an increase in noncontrolling interests in property partnerships of $0.05 per share at the mid-point, (5) an increase in G & A expense of $0.03 per share at the mid-point and (6) a decrease in development and management services revenue of $0.01 per share at the mid-point.

Press Release: Boston Properties  Announces Third -4-

(1) Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (""NAREIT""), we calculate Funds from Operations, or ""FFO,"" by adjusting net income (loss) attributable to Boston Properties, Inc . common shareholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, impairment losses on depreciable real estate consolidated on our balance sheet, impairment losses on our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and real estate-related depreciation and amortization. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure, but we believe the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO and FFO per share to be useful measures for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO per share can help investors compare the operating performance of a company's real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies.

Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently.

In order to facilitate a clear understanding of the Company's operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc . common shareholders as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements. FFO should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc . common shareholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the Company's financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

PR Newswire","CHARLOTTE, N.C., Nov. 15, 2017

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Nov. 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) announced today that it will build a full-range merchant bar quality (MBQ) mill at its existing bar steel mill located in Bourbonnais, Illinois. The MBQ mill will have an annual capacity of 500,000 tons and is expected to cost $180 million. The project will take approximately two years to complete.

""This new MBQ mill is right in line with our long-term strategy for profitable growth. It takes advantage of our position as a low-cost producer to displace tons currently being supplied by competitors outside the region. It also builds on our market leadership position by further enhancing our product offerings of merchant bar, light shapes and structural angle and channel in markets in the central U.S.,"" said John Ferriola , Chairman, CEO & President of Nucor. ""Combined with our other full-range bar mills, we are now strategically located to supply all markets with high-quality bar products and exceptional service.""

The Midwest region is one of the largest markets for MBQ products, and Nucor is ideally situated to take advantage of existing operating and commercial capabilities to meet this regional demand. This project will allow Nucor to fully utilize the Company's existing bar mill by optimizing its melt capacity and infrastructure that is already in place. It will also take advantage of an abundant scrap supply in the region, as well as the Company's commercial footprint in the central United States. Nucor Steel Kankakee, Inc. will continue to be a supplier of quality reinforcing bar products.

""We are very excited to bring new investment and jobs to the Kankakee community and the State of Illinois,"" said Johnny Jacobs, Vice President & General Manager of Nucor Steel Kankakee. ""We would like to thank Governor Rauner, state and local officials, our teammates and the entire community for their support of this project. Nucor 's bar mills have been a cornerstone of our company and, as this project demonstrates, they are an important part of Nucor 's future.""

2017-11-15,MU,Cardinal Health Selling Chinese Distribution Ops -- Market Talk,"2049 ET - Amid Cardinal Health 's struggles this year as the drug-distributor industry has hit a pothole and the company about to lose its CEO, it has reached a $1.2 billion deal to sell its Chinese distribution operations to Shanghai Pharma . Cardinal will hold on to its other businesses there, including the recently acquired patient-recovery unit. Cardinal Health has been a distributor in China for 7 years and ""we recognize that significant scale is required to be a market leader"" there, says CEO George Barrett . The firms add they will work together on possible opportunities in both the US and China. Shanghai Pharma is up 1% in Hong Kong, nearly erasing the week's drop. Shares are up just 9.2% this year. Meanwhile, Cardinal has slumped 21% in 2017, today hitting a fresh 4-year low. (kevin.kingsbury@wsj.com; @kevinkingsbury)","1844 ET - Moody's says it's changing its outlook on Citigroup 's debt to ""positive"" from ""stable,"" an indication the firm sees improvement in the bank's core business. ""Citigroup has largely completed its sweeping reengineering, which has resulted in a more solvent institution with an improved risk-attuned management culture, in part thanks to enhanced regulation,"" Moody's says. Moody's says it could further upgrade its bond rating on Citigroup if it meets management's ""strategic targets without compromising on risk appetite or controls."" Citigroup 's senior debt is rated Baa1, which is one notch below the A ratings. (telis.demos@wsj.com; @telisdemos)

1834 ET - Oil futures are down another 1% in Asian trading after falling at least 1.5% overnight, getting further pressure the past several hours by a bearish inventory reading from API. The industry group says crude and gasoline supplies both rose last week, while analysts have been expecting Wednesday's government reading to show slight declines in both. Some selling has been overdue amid the run to 2-year highs of late despite a lack of overwhelming evidence that a years-long supply glut is close to ending.

1829 ET - Communications Workers of America comes out late but strong backing AT&T 's takeover of Time Warner , continuing a trend of blessing the telecom company's M&A moves. Union president Chris Shelton says the deal gives ""much-needed new competition to companies like Google , Facebook , and Amazon , where working people don't have union representation,"" echoing executives' arguments for why Justice Department antitrust officials should back off. It's not all buddy-buddy, though, as CWA negotiations over a new wireless workers' contract drags into its ninth month. AT&T employed more than 250K workers at the end of September, many of them unionized. (andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com; @drewfitzgerald)

1800 ET - New Trump Administration policy changes partly restricting US tourism in Cuba led to the latest discontinuation of airline flights. Alaska Air says it'll drop a daily flight linking Los Angeles and Havana on Jan. 22. Alaska said 80% of its fliers visited under a US allowance for individual ""people-to-people"" educational travel, which is no longer allowed. Low-fare Sun Country Airlines recently relinquished its rights to serve Santa Clara and Matanzas, Cuba, from Minneapolis. Spirit Airlines and Silver Airways already abandoned Cuba flights and American Airlines earlier trimmed its daily flights to the island nation to 10 from 13 and will drop a flight to Cienfuegos from Miami in January. More schedule changes could occur as airlines absorb the new rules, which also put 80 Cuban hotels off limits to Americans. (susan.carey@wsj.com)

1753 ET - Paulson & Co . sold off all holdings in American International Group during the third quarter, parting with 4.1 million shares. The hedge fund at one point was engaged in a public fight with the insurer about the company's structure and performance but eventually dropped it after receiving a board seat.

1733 ET - Bruce Berkowitz's Fairholme Capital Management LLC sold all its shares in Lands' End in 3Q, and slightly reduced its stake in Sears Holding 's, according to a securities filing. The fund reduced its shares in Sears to 28.51M from 28.86M in 2Q. Berkowitz, Fairholme's chief investment manager, stepped down from Sears 's board in October. Over the years, he has been a champion of Sears, arguing that investors have undervalued its real estate. The retailer continues to struggle under the leadership of financier Edward Lampert .

1721 ET - Billionaire investor George Soros 's hedge fund sharply lowered its investment in two social media giants, while betting big on traditional media.

At the same time, the fund bought $44.5 million of Time Warner and $61 million of Comcast . The Comcast purchase marked a new position for the hedge fund. The billionaire also sold out of his positions in Snap. (geoffrey.rogow@wsj.com )

1716 ET - After penning a series of letters asking the Trump administration to take heed of the US farm sector's heavy reliance on Nafta to underpin food exports, farm groups and major agricultural companies are turning to state governors for help. A letter sent Thursday to the top executive offices of all 50 states asks for governors' help to ""let President Trump know"" that states support modernizing the trade pact, not scrapping it, and to let negotiations continue ""without the threat of withdrawal."" The letter, signed by groups representing farmers and ranchers as well as agribusiness companies like ADM, Cargill and Smithfield Foods , comes after Trump has threatened to withdraw from Nafta, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has said Trump is ""not a bluffer."" (jacob.bunge@wsj.com; @jacobbunge)

1712 ET - David Einhorn 's Greenlight Capital continued to pare its stake in General Motors in 3Q, according to a recent securities filing. Einhorn waged an unsuccessful battle for the auto maker to split its stock into two classes earlier this year, but GM remains Greenlight's largest position. As of Sept. 30 including options, Einhorn's GM stake was valued at nearly $1.5B. Among Greenlight's big moves in the quarter: the hedge fund sold off its stake in power company Calpine , opened a big position in Exela Technologies and continued to build its position in Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Micron Technology . The fund's portfolio value rose 1.2% to $6.27B. (maria.armental@wsj.com; @mjarmental)

1700 ET - United Continental reaped a huge PR boost after it let passengers fly on its last 747 flight from San Francisco to Honolulu last week. Now Delta, the last US passenger-airline operator to retire the 747, is counting down to its farewell to the ""Queen of the Skies"" in December. The last scheduled round trips will run between Detroit and Seoul in mid-December, then the plane will go on a farewell tour, taking in hubs in Detroit, Seattle, Atlanta and Minneapolis. Customers can bid for spots using their frequent-flier miles and employees and retirees can purchase seats at discounted rates. Delta said it will fly some sports teams and charter flights through Dec. 31, then fly the final plane to a boneyard in Arizona. (susan.carey@wsj.com)

1648 ET - Don't expect Verizon to rush out and spend billions of dollars on licenses for wireless airwaves. During a meeting with reporters at a network facility in New Jersey, a top Verizon network executive said he is quite happy with the airwaves the carrier currently owns. The move to unlimited data plans hasn't crushed the network, he says, largely because Verizon has gotten so good at adding new cell sites while shrinking the coverage footprint of each one, meaning fewer customers attach to each. ""We are going to be in fine shape capacity wise,"" says Mike Haberman, a top network official. ""That is not something I wake up and worry about--that I'm going to run out of capacity.""

2017-11-14,D,Press Release: Dominion Energy Virginia Takes Step to Secure Carbon-Free Power from North Anna Facility Through Mid-Century,"Dominion Energy Virginia Takes Step to Secure Carbon-Free Power from North Anna Facility Through Mid-Century

- Company notifies the NRC of intent to renew operating licenses of North Anna Power Station for additional 20-year term","- Customers will benefit from continued safe, reliable, always-on electricity from Louisa County energy facility

- Renewal is part of Dominion Energy 's strategy to maintain lower carbon emissions in Virginia

PR Newswire

RICHMOND, Va., Nov. 13, 2017

RICHMOND, Va., Nov. 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Dominion Energy Virginia, a unit of Dominion Energy, Inc ., today notified the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC ) of its intent to relicense North Anna Power Station in Louisa County for an additional 20-year term, ensuring Virginia customers will continue to benefit from the safe, reliable, and carbon-free electricity the station produces for decades to come.

The company informed the NRC Monday that it expects to file a license renewal application for its two-unit North Anna Power Station in 2020. The company informed the NRC in November 2015 that it would file a similar application to renew the licenses of its two Surry Power Station units in the spring of 2019.

Daniel G. Stoddard , chief nuclear officer for Dominion's nuclear generation division, stated: ""Renewing North Anna Power Station's licenses for a second 20-year period is the right thing to do for our customers, the regional economy and the environment,"" Stoddard said. ""The planned relicensing of North Anna and Surry ensures that the benefits of these clean energy sources will continue to provide affordable, reliable, carbon-free electricity to our customers through the middle of the century. Our nuclear power stations have proven to be among the most-efficient and most-reliable sources of electricity in our fleet.

""The operation of North Anna and Surry also positions Virginia for economic growth. It directly supports more than 2,000 high-paying jobs in Virginia and produces additional economic and tax benefits. Their continued operation will go a long way toward meeting and maintaining both federal and state goals for lowering carbon emissions in the Commonwealth.""

The company is reviewing all technical aspects associated with the renewal of North Anna Power Station's licenses, and while not yet complete, sees no significant barriers that would prevent a license renewal submittal in 2020. The letter of intent is necessary so the NRC can plan its staffing needs to support the license renewal effort. The company expects to invest up to $4 billion on upgrades to North Anna and Surry as part of the relicensing process.

North Anna Power Station is located in Louisa County, Va. Its two nuclear units -- both three-loop Westinghouse pressurized water reactors -- provide 1,892 net megawatts of electricity, or enough power for 473,000 homes. Unit 1 began commercial service in 1978 and Unit 2 began commercial service in 1980.

Surry Power Station is located in Surry County, Va. Its two nuclear units -- also three-loop Westinghouse pressurized water reactors -- provide 1,676 net megawatts of electricity or enough power for 419,000 homes. Unit 1 began commercial service in 1972 and Unit 2 began commercial service in 1973.

Like all U.S. nuclear units, the North Anna and Surry units were originally licensed to operate for 40 years. All four units' licenses were renewed for 20 additional years of operation on March 20, 2003, following a stringent review process authorized under federal law. The North Anna and Surry nuclear units' respective licenses currently will expire in 2038 and 2040, and 2032 and 2033. After renewal, the respective licenses for North Anna and Surry will allow the units to operate to 2058 and 2060, and 2052 and 2053.

Dominion Energy also operates two nuclear units at its Millstone Power Station, located in Waterford, Conn. In 2005 the company renewed the station's operating license for one 20-year term, which means the current license for Unit 2 will expire in 2035, and in 2045 for Unit 3. Millstone Power Station provides New England and Connecticut with low-cost, carbon-free, around-the-clock electricity. The station's output powers 2 million homes and generates the equivalent of over half the electricity consumed in Connecticut. The company may consider another 20-year renewed license for Millstone, but has made no decision to do so at this time.

2017-11-14,RSG,*Fitch Rates Republic Services' Proposed $650MM Senior Unsecured Notes 'BBB',"13 Nov 2017 15:46 ET 
Press Release: Fitch Rates Republic Services' Proposed $650MM Senior Unsecured Notes 'BBB'


 
 
The following is a press release from Fitch Ratings : 
 ","Fitch Ratings-New York-13 November 2017: Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of 'BBB' to Republic Services, Inc .'s (RSG) proposed $650 million senior notes due 2027. RSG intends to use the proceeds to repay amounts borrowed under its unsecured credit facilities, in addition to general corporate purposes.

Fitch currently rates RSG's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured debt 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Positive. The ratings cover approximately $8 billion of debt as of June 30, 2017. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

The Positive Outlook is supported by RSG's second largest market position within the environmental services sector, stable credit metrics, constructive industry dynamics, and demonstrated consistent focus on its core business. RSG has exhibited consistently high profitability levels for over a decade including during significant residential housing, commercial and industrial downturns. Further supporting RSG's rating outlook is its defensive position in an ever-consolidating industry. RSG benefits from roughly 60% of its revenue is derived from either franchise/exclusive or small and mid-size markets where it maintains considerable pricing power and or limited competition.

Fitch believes that the risk profile of the waste services industry has materially decreased in recent years. The industry as a whole has become more disciplined with respect to its core solid waste operations; largely shedding ancillary ventures which have historically been less productive from a capital efficiency standpoint. The industry has begun to utilize big data in its continued focus on pricing discipline, with a demonstrated willingness to shed low-margin legacy business. In addition, the industry has made collective gains with an increased focus on higher-quality indexing or inflation adjustments in customer contracts. Fitch believes that increased consolidation, largely driven by tuck-in acquisitions of the roughly 35% of the U.S. and Canadian market that remains closely held, provides considerable runway for acquisitive growth. Fitch further assesses that the relatively limited wallet share (for both commercial and residential customers) that the industry represents further underpins continued pricing power.

Through the second quarter of 2017 (2Q17), the company has generated revenue growth of roughly 5% on a latest 12 months (LTM) basis which compares favorably to revenue gains of 3% and 3.5% in fiscal year (FY) 2016 and FY2015 respectively. Recent revenue gains are attributed to increased average yield, recycled commodity volumes, greater volumes and fuel recovery fees and acquisitions. The change in revenue is primarily due to increases in average yield of 2.4%, recycled commodities of 1.8% and volume of 1.5% during the six months ended June 30, 2017.

Through 2Q17, RSG generated 28.3% EBITDA margins on a LTM basis. This compares to the 28.5% and 28.9% margins generated in FY2016 and FY2015, respectively. In 2016, RSG realigned its field support functions by combining its three regions into two field groups, consolidating service areas and streamlining operational support roles at its headquarters. The company also consolidated over 100 customer service support locations and Fitch expects the company's restructuring efforts to continue through 2017. Fitch expects RSG to generate roughly 28% EBITDA margins for FY2017 and for margins to continue to expand toward 30% over the medium term.

Rating concerns include the company's exposure to the more volatile petroleum exploration and production (E&P) sector, somewhat volatile recycling commodity revenues, frequent acquisition activity and the potential for a significant increase in shareholder-friendly activities. Concerns also include the potential for significant cash costs related to environmental clean-up at landfills or a material shift in the firm's financial strategy.

Through 2Q17, RSG generated $540 million of free cash flow (FCF; post-dividend) on a LTM basis, up from roughly $500 million and $334 million in FY2016 and FY2015 respectively. Fitch notes that FCF advances have been driven by operational improvements while capital intensity and working capital needs have largely remained consistent during this period. Fitch expects RSG's FY2017 FCF margin to be roughly 6%, up from 5.3% and 3.7% in FY2016 and FY2015 respectively.

Through 2Q17, RSG had total adjusted debt/EBITDAR of 3.0x on a LTM basis, which has been flat since FY2015. Through 2Q17, the company's total debt/EBITDA was 2.9x, which has also been flat since FY2015. Fitch expects the company's leverage metrics to largely remain within this range and does not expect the company's total adjusted debt/EBITDAR to rise above 3.0x for a significant period of time in the medium term.

DERIVATION SUMMARY

RSG compares favorably to its peer, Waste Management and Waste Connections , as the second largest firm by market share in the environmental services sector. The company's leverage metrics have remained consistent with adjusted debt/EBITDAR at roughly 3.0x in recent years. FCF levels have improved in recent years largely driven by operational improvements and opportunistic, high-quality revenue growth.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include:

--Low single-digit revenue growth through the medium term;

--EBITDA margins of at least 28% through the medium term;

--Capital expenditures of roughly $975 million in FY2017;

--Dividends of roughly $450 million in FY2017;

--Share repurchases of roughly $450 million in FY2017;

--Tuck-in acquisitions of roughly $100 million in FY2017.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action

--A change to a more conservative financial strategy;

--FCF margin consistently greater than 4%;

--Maintaining total adjusted debt/EBITDAR below 2.5x for a prolonged period.

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action

--A change to a less conservative financial strategy;

--FCF margin consistently lower than 2%;

--Maintaining total adjusted debt/EBITDAR above 3.25x for a prolonged period;

--Debt funded shareholder-friendly activity.

LIQUIDITY

RSG continues to maintain adequate liquidity. As of the end of 2Q17, the company had $36 million in cash and $1.6 billion in revolver capacity ($2.25 billion less drawings and letters of credit). In addition to its strong liquidity, the company has no major debt maturities in the near future. RSG's two primary revolving credit facilities do not mature until 2019 and 2021 with none of its unsecured notes maturing prior to 2018.

FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS

Fitch currently rates RSG as follows with a Positive Outlook:

Republic Services, Inc .

--IDR 'BBB';

--Senior unsecured revolving credit facility 'BBB';

--Senior unsecured notes 'BBB'.

Brown-Ferris Industries, Inc.

--IDR 'BBB';

--Senior unsecured notes 'BBB'.

This is bad news for housing-market enthusiasts, but even worse for those looking for a home in already construction-starved but competitive markets. In recent months, lackluster homebuilding has led to a run-up in home prices, potentially pricing many out of the market and causing several housing-related economic indicators to decelerate. Add to that a further slowing of home construction and you have a recipe for surging home prices, if demand keeps up. (sharon.nunn@wsj.com)

Stevens said the company continues to aim to top 10% margins in North America in 2017.

Aerospace was the only division to see sales drop slightly driven by decline in providing parts to commercial aircraft makers, including landing gear for Boeing 777, and wide body jet production slowed. UTX expects the division to pick up in the second half as narrow body jet growth accelerates. For its Otis division, the focus continues to be uncertainty in China where UTX gained market share but had a slower conversion of backlog into sales. (thomas.gryta@wsj.com; @tgryta)

Rising Wages Buoy","Sales at Discounter

Dollar Tree Inc.'s profit shot up 41% in the latest quarter and margins expanded amid more shoppers coming to the retailer's stores -- and spending more.

Chief Executive Bob Sasser called the market for discount retail ""the most attractive sector"" of a struggling industry. Like rival Dollar General Corp., Dollar Tree generally has benefited from rising wages among core customers.

Same-store sales at Dollar Tree rose 2.3%, and same-store sales at its Family Dollar locations edged up 0.2%.

Over all, for the quarter ended Jan. 28, Dollar Tree reported net income of $321.8 million, or $1.36 a share, compared with $229 million, or 97 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Sales rose 5% to $5.64 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected per-share earnings of $1.32 on $5.62 billion in revenue.

BEST BUY

Shortages Crimped

Holiday Performance

Best Buy Co. couldn't keep its shelves stocked with enough highly sought-after electronics during the crucial holiday season, triggering a surprise drop in revenue and a warning that shortages could continue in the first half of the year.

The retailer had previously said it expected to lose about $200 million because of Samsung Electronics Co.'s recall of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. But Best Buy Chief Executive Hubert Joly said in a call with analysts Wednesday that the other shortages ""felt unprecedented,"" accounting for another $100 million to $200 million in lost revenue. Best Buy said it anticipated shortages to continue to affect revenue in the first half.

Best Buy earned $607 million, or $1.91 a share in the fourth quarter, up from $479 million, or $1.40 a share, a year ago. Revenue slipped 1%, to $13.48 billion.

EpiPen Controversy

Appears to Fade

Mylan NV's profit more than doubled in the final quarter of the year as the drugmaker posted double-digit sales gains across regions.

During the quarter, Mylan seemed to move past its EpiPen pricing controversy. After broad criticism, Mylan in December launched a generic version of the lifesaving drug at half the price.

In all for the three months ended Dec. 31, Mylan earned $417.5 million, or 78 cents a share, up from $194.6 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier.

Adjusted earnings climbed to $1.57 a share. Revenue surged 31% to $3.27 billion. Analysts were looking for $1.42 in adjusted earnings on $3.17 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters.

BCBG MAX AZRIA GROUP

Apparel Retailer

Seeks Chapter 11

Women's apparel retailer BCBG Max Azria Group LLC sought chapter 11 protection Tuesday with plans to pull back on brick-and-mortar stores as more shoppers head online.

BCBG, whose name is an acronym for the French phrase ""bon chic, bon genre,"" or ""good style, good attitude,"" said Wednesday that its chapter 11 case could take the form of a stand-alone restructuring, a sale or a merger.

Known for selling women's dresses for somewhere between $250 and $750, BCBG blamed its bankruptcy on a heavy debt load as well as industrywide trends like the consumer shift to online shopping and expensive leases.
