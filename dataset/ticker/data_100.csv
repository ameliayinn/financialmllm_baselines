Companies Eye Dividends Despite Coronavirus Challenges -- Market Talk,"1204 GMT - Experian 's results for the first half of fiscal 2021 reflected the FTSE 100 credit-reporting agency's strategic positioning, delivering a modest improvement in revenues, Shore Capital says.The U.K. investment group says the company's performance was strong amid the coronavirus pandemic, as its growth in South America and North America came to 10% and 9% respectively in the second quarter.

0734 GMT - JD.com eyes a significant opportunity in the supermarket category, based on management's comments, HSBC says, while maintaining the American Depositary Receipt's buy rating. Management highlighted an addressable market of CNY690 billion, with the top 10 supermarket chains accounting for only about 5% of the market, HSBC notes. JD.com has expanded its online and physical presence, investing in business-to-consumer and warehouse stores, and it will continue to invest in new initiatives to achieve long-term growth, HSBC says. However, it lowers the ADR's target price to $98.00 from $100.00 as management's reinvestment plans may lead to slower margin expansion. JD.com 's ADRs closed 7.4% lower at $85.26 on Monday.

Press Release: S&PGR: China's Ant IPO Suspension A Sign Of Tightening Regs,"
 
 
The following is a press release from S&P Global Ratings: 
 
HONG KONG (S&P Global Ratings) Nov. 17, 2020--Proposed rule changes on 
internet lending cited in the recent abrupt suspension of Ant Group Co. Ltd .'s 
IPO are in line with Chinese regulatory trends, given technological 
disruptions in finance are insufficiently captured by the existing regulatory 
framework. S&P Global Ratings expects the Chinese government will continue to 
update its regulations and guidelines to manage the growth and risks brought 
by the fast evolving fintech industry. 
 
""The withdrawal of Ant Group's IPO underlines the uncertainties facing fintech 
companies as Chinese regulators seek to reduce uncontrolled technological 
disruption in banking and protect consumers from excessive borrowing,"" said 
S&P Global Ratings credit analyst Fern Wang. 
 
The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) and the People's 
Bank Of China (PBOC ) jointly announced the ""Draft Interim Internet 
Micro-lending Governance Rules"" on Nov.2, 2020, to be followed by a one-month 
consultation period. If implemented, the regulation could severely weaken Ant 
Group's consumer and small and micro finance business. This segment 
contributed as much as 39% to its first half 2020 revenue and is the major 
growth engine of the group. 
 
The rule change would likely slow lending growth for the more than 200 
licensed internet lenders in China. These online lenders typically offer 
small, unsecured loans and are not permitted to take deposits. Their licenses 
were initially granted by local financial bureaus under relatively lax 
regulations compared with those for banks. The new regulations aim at 
constraining leverage for such lenders, and preventing excessive consumer 
borrowing. 
 
The proposed regulations are also designed to create a more level playing 
field and reduce regulatory arbitrage, in our view. Banks for example, are 
subject to tight regulatory oversight and are expected to provide a reasonable 
level of capital contribution to their unsecured consumer lending business. 
 
In comparison Ant Group, for example, does not need much capital commitment to 
run its consumer lending business. It only retains on its balance sheet 2% of 
the total outstanding credit balance on loans it originated; 98% of the loans 
originated were off-loaded to investors via structured finance products or to 
commercial banks that were keen in expanding their exposures to consumer 
credits. Some 80% of Ant Group's originated loans are to individual retail 
customers. The total as the end of the first half of 2020 amounted to about 
Chinese renminbi 2.1 trillion (US$325 billion). 
 
In contrast to the emphasis on innovation and risk-taking that fintech 
companies wanted, China's proposed rules on internet financing would constrain 
cross-provincial lending; limit maximum loan amounts; require a minimum 30% 
capital contribution to joint borrowing, restrict leverage including use of 
asset-backed securities instruments; and impose minimal capital requirements 
on the internet small loans companies. 
 
""While pro-innovation, Chinese regulators' top priority is financial 
stability,"" said Ms. Wang. ""They have a particularly strong incentive to 
manage fast-growing consumer lending to lower-income borrowers."" 
 
Our analysis shows that China's banking system is more exposed to 
technological disruption than those of other major countries'. To analyze the 
impact of fintech on retail banking, S&P Global has developed a four-factor 
gauge of banking systems sensitivity to technology, regulation, industry, and 
client preferences (TRIP). Of the 22 markets/countries to which we've applied 
TRIP analysis, China is the only one assessed as having a very high disruption 
risk from technology. This is due to the significant inroads made by China's 
Big Tech firms in fintech through their platform and heavy investment in 
technologies like Big Data, AI analytics, and loud computing (see ""Tech 
Disruption In Retail Banking: China's Banks Are Playing Catch-Up To Big Tech, 
published on RatingsDirect on May 14, 2019). 
 
In China, fintech is dominated by large firms such as Alibaba Group Holding 
Ltd .'s Ant Group and Tencent Holdings Ltd . Such firms have turned China's 
consumer market into one of the world's most digitalized, as measured for 
example by the percentage of online sales to total retail spending. These 
companies are driving disruption in retail banking with e-payments, 
deposit-like funds, and Big Data-assisted consumer lending. 
 
Since 2017, China implemented a series of regulations to manage disruptions 
caused by fast-growing fintech activities. New rules were rolled out after a 
money market fund under Ant Group, Yu'ebao, grew to become the world's 
largest--raising the specter of liquidity shocks in the event of mass 
withdrawals. The subsequent regulations on money market funds constrained 
growth. 
 
Regulators have also implemented a centralized payment clearing system 
(NetUnion) to prevent settlement risk of payment companies. Third-party 
payment services such as Alipay and WeChat  Pay now have to deposit 100% of 
clients' funds with the PBOC , no longer enjoying the advantage of earning 
interest on those deposits. 
 
In 2017, regulators reined in the unfettered growth in the peer to peer (P2P) 
consumer fintech industry driving most of these players out of the industry. 
CBIRC indicated in November 2020 that only a handful P2P internet lenders are 
left from a peak of over 7,000 just before the new rules took hold. 
Authorities cited predatory lending as the main impetus for tightening 
licensing and oversight in the P2P market. 
 
""We expect the Chinese government will further update its regulations and 
guidelines to manage the growth and risks brought by the fast evolving fintech 
industry,"" said S&P Global Ratings credit analyst Ryan Tsang. ""The challenge 
for regulators is to find a fine balance in encouraging innovation and keeping 
associated risks in check to make sure financial system stability is not 
jeopardized. We also believe they will seek to reduce opportunities for 
regulatory arbitrage to level the playing field in terms of regulatory 
supervision for fintech players and traditional financial services providers.

Press Release: BittWare Launches IA-840F with Intel(R) Agilex(TM) FPGA and Support for oneAPI(TM) Unified Software Programming Environment,"CONCORD, N.H., Nov. 17, 2020

CONCORD, N.H., Nov. 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- BittWare, a Molex company, today unveiled the IA-840F, the company's first Intel(R) Agilex(TM)-based FPGA card designed to deliver significant performance-per-watt improvements for next-generation data center, networking and edge compute workloads. Agilex FPGAs deliver up to 40% higher performance or up to 40% lower power, depending on application requirements. BittWare maximized I/O features using the Agilex chip's unique tiling architecture with dual QSFP-DDs (4× 100G), PCIe Gen4 x16, and three MCIO expansion ports for diverse applications. BittWare also announced support for Intel oneAPI(TM), which enables an abstracted development flow for dramatically simplified code re-use across multiple architectures.

""Modern data center workloads are incredibly diverse, requiring customers to implement a mix of scalar, vector, matrix and spatial architectures,"" said Craig Petrie, vice president of marketing for BittWare. ""The IA-840F ensures that customers can quickly and easily exploit the advanced features of the Intel Agilex FPGA. For those customers who prefer to develop FPGA applications at an abstracted level, we are including support for oneAPI. This new unified software programming environment allows customers to program the Agilex FPGA from a single code base with native high-level language performance across architectures.""

The new IA-84F offers enterprise-class features and capabilities, including: 


   -- Support for Intel oneAPI unified software programming environment 
 
   -- HDL developer toolkit: API, PCIe drivers, application example designs and 
      diagnostic self-test 
 
   -- Sophisticated Board Management Controller (BMC) 
 
   -- Choice of thermal cooling options: Passive, active or liquid 
 
   -- Multiple expansion port for additional PCIe, storage or network I/O 

To streamline cross-architecture development, oneAPI includes a direct programming language, Data Parallel C++, and a set of libraries for API-based programming. Data Parallel C++ is based on C++ and incorporates SYCL from the Khronos Group. This dramatically simplifies code re-use across multiple architectures while facilitating custom tuning for accelerators.

""Intel Agilex FPGAs and cross platform tools including the oneAPI toolkit are leading the way to enable easier access to these newest FPGAs and their tremendous capabilities - including eASIC integration, HBM integration, BFLOAT16, optimized tensor compute blocks, Compute Express Link (CXL), and 112 Gbps transceiver data rates for high speed 1Ghz compute and 400Gbps+ connectivity solutions,"" said Patrick Dorsey , VP Product, Programmable Solutions Group at Intel . ""The highly customizable and heterogenous Agilex platform and oneAPI tools enable products like the new IA-840F accelerator card from BittWare to drive innovation from the edge to the cloud.""

First IA-840F card shipments are scheduled to begin Q2 2021. Customers can purchase the new card as a pre-integrated DELL or HPE server from the BittWare TeraBox range with a comprehensive three-year warranty. Each TeraBox server is delivered with pre-installed FPGA card, operating system, driver and tools. Please visit www.BittWare.com for product portfolio details.

"Press Release: Amazon Named ""Low Price Leader"" in New Study","
SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 17, 2020-- 

Amazon.com, Inc . (NASDAQ: AMZN) was named the low price leader in Profitero's annual ""Price Wars"" study. The comprehensive analysis, now in its fourth year, compares prices on over 18,400 products at Amazon , Walmart , Target, Staples , Home Depot , Wayfair, Macy's , Walgreen 's, CVS, Kroger , Nordstrom, Best Buy , Lowes, and Chewy, and found Amazon offered customers the lowest prices most often and most consistently.

The study compared products in 21 categories important to customers, including household supplies, health and personal care, office supplies, home furniture, electronics, appliances and more. Amazon proved to be the lowest priced option in all categories, with the largest potential customer savings, on average, in Home Furniture (35% more affordable than other options in the category), Vitamins and Supplements (34%), Health and Personal Care (26%) and Beauty (22%).

Blackstone Flexes Its Muscles in Hollywood,"The project, which will be positioned to attract employees in the entertainment business, is a sign that space serving the TV and film industries is one of the few bright spots in the office sector during the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced many employees to work from home.

“Content creation is one of our highest conviction themes,” said Nadeem Meghji, Blackstone’s head of real estate Americas. “We’re seeing long-term demand growth.”

Like data centers and cold-storage warehouses, production-related facilities are niche property investments that have performed well of late. They are attracting more investment dollars as property owners sour on traditional holdings such as hotels, retail space and office buildings during the pandemic.

The virus that causes Covid-19 has prompted Hollywood to close theaters, postpone film releases, lay off workers and cut costs. But the high consumption of streaming content by hundreds of millions of people sheltering at home is translating into strong demand for studios where it is produced and the office space that supports it.

Starting in August, casts and crews began returning to their studio sets. Several of California’s largest leases signed since the pandemic hit have been in Burbank, including one for 170,000 square feet that Netflix Inc. agreed to in September.

“The studio parking lots are full again because people are back filming,” said Jeff Worthe, president of Worthe Real Estate and the largest owner and developer of office space in Burbank.

Mr. Worthe said the decision to move ahead with the new building was made recently at a meeting of the venture that he formed with Blackstone in 2017. The venture owns 13 buildings and five development parcels, acquired for a total of $1.7 billion.

“It’s very difficult to produce a television show on Zoom,” he said. “You need the writers together in the writers’ room. You need to cast it. You need to film and edit it.”

Blackstone has been involved in other entertainment deals since the pandemic began. The firm in June purchased a 49% stake in a venture that will own three film-studio lots and five adjacent buildings in Hollywood, in a $1.65 billion deal. Netflix, CBS and Walt Disney Co. are among the facilities’ customers, according to Hudson Pacific Properties Inc., which kept a 51% stake.

Blackstone and Worthe are likely to break ground on the new building in 2022 on a site adjoining an existing office tower. That 480,000-square-foot property is fully leased thanks partly to demand from the Burbank Studios, which is across the street.

Burbank Studios is a 35-acre complex, and includes the site of the former NBC Studios where Johnny Carson hosted “The Tonight Show.” Warner Bros. said last year that it would expand into two new Frank Gehry-designed office buildings and other properties in the complex.

The new development comes at a difficult time for the Los Angeles office market, which has suffered during the pandemic. With many employees working from home, leasing volume has fallen sharply and sublease space on the market swelled to 6 million square feet in September, up 46% from a year earlier, according to CBRE Group Inc.

But most of that sublease space is coming from startups and other smaller companies. “We’re not seeing large offerings from the studio players,” said Eric Willett, a CBRE research director.

At the same time, the pandemic has fueled demand for Los Angeles studio space because actors and crews are reluctant to travel to shoot scenes for fear of the virus.

“The potential of another uptick puts renewed attention on sound stages locally,” said Carl Muhlstein, an international director with real-estate firm JLL.

Office buildings located close to studios are considered especially healthy. For example, in July, DBRS Morningstar issued new ratings on some $660 million in debt, most of it backed by four of the buildings in the Blackstone-Worthe partnership. The ratings showed no deterioration from ratings on the bonds before the pandemic.

The ratings report says that leasing risk in the portfolio is limited by the properties’ proximity to studio headquarters. One of the buildings “is considered a mission-critical location for Disney, which has invested over $40 million in the building’s infrastructure,” the report states.

Moderna Gets Wall Street Reappraisal After Its Positive Covid-19 Vaccine News -- Barrons.com,"Wall Street's average price target for Moderna stock is now $107, according to FactSet, compared with $92 a month ago.

One of Moderna's most ardent fans has been Oppenheimer's Hartaj Singh. Now that Moderna's messenger-RNA technology has proven its clinical value, Hartaj has lifted his target price on the stock to $157 from $108. That would value Moderna -- which has yet to ship its first product -- at a cool $68 billion.

George Farmer at BMO Capital Markets also raised his Moderna price target on Tuesday, to $109 from $94. But he downgraded his rating to Market Perform from Outperform.

""The success of near-term catalysts are largely reflected in the company's share price,"" Farmer said in a note. Still, he believes that the new proof of Moderna's technology ""establishes the company as a new vaccine development powerhouse.""

Farmer's near-term expectations for Moderna hinge on the average price it will obtain for its Covid vaccine. His $109 target price assumes a price of $16 a dose. At $20 a dose, he thinks the stock could reach $143. But a lower $12 a dose would reduce the stock's value to $78. Vaccine pricing will reflect competition from Pfizer and other developers like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), AstraZeneca (AZN), Novavax (NVAX), and Sanofi (SNY).

One of the more dour followers of Moderna has been Mani Foroohar of SVB Leerink. In September, he took his Moderna price target down to $41 and his rating to an Underperform. Acknowledging the ""remarkable early efficacy"" shown for the company's vaccine, Foroohar nudged his target price up to $59 in a Tuesday note, while maintaining his Sell recommendation.

Most interesting are Foroohar's views on other vaccines, in light of the strong showings by Pfizer and Moderna. He thinks it bodes well for the effectiveness of any vaccine that targets the virus's spike protein, which most do. The Covid-preventing prowess of the Pfizer and Moderna shots seems to track the high-level of anti-coronavirus antibodies they produced in recipients. That is encouraging for vaccines with a strong antibody showing in early trials, like Novavax.

But the SVB Leerink analyst also sees the distribution of the first vaccines as closing a window for testing the 45 other candidates in clinical development. Foroohar fears it will become difficult to recruit volunteers for placebo-controlled trials after mid-2021, when shots from Pfizer and Moderna become more widely available.

If a vaccine developer isn't in Phase 3 trials now, he surmises, it may soon be too late.

After the pandemic is tamed, Foroohar sees vaccine developers making Covid shots part of a combined seasonal vaccination, along with an influenza shot.

""We know that the entire Gladstone team understands the unique challenges and opportunities facing the modern advisor and our clients,"" Gallagher said.

Sen. Rob Portman Says He Is Enrolled in J&J Covid Vaccine Trial,"J&J, of New Brunswick, N.J., had paused trials (https://www.wsj.com/articles/johnson-johnson-pauses-covid-19-vaccine-trials-due-to-sick-subject-11602555101) in October, citing an unexplained illness in a person enrolled in one of the trials, but the trials have since restarted. The late-stage, or Phase 3, trial began in September and is aiming to enroll up to 60,000 people in the U.S. and several other countries, to test whether a single dose safely protects people from Covid-19.

""I hope that my announcement today will encourage others to feel confident in participating in vaccine clinical trials being conducted across this country,"" Mr. Portman said. ""I also hope it will reassure people about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines once they have gone through the trials and FDA approval process.""

The J&J vaccine is one of several under development. Moderna Inc. said this week its experimental coronavirus vaccine (https://www.wsj.com/articles/moderna-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-was-94-5-effective-in-latest-trial-11605528008) was 94.5% effective at protecting people from Covid-19 in an early look at pivotal study results, the second vaccine to hit a key milestone in U.S. testing.

1620 ET - Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, says that without a meaningful support package the economy will fall back into recession in the first half of 2021.

1340 ET - The domestic business travel spending forecast will drop 55% this year compared with 2019, far worse than the projected 34% fall in leisure business, says the US Travel Association in its latest update. The lobby group says 3.5M direct travel jobs have already disappeared and another 1M are at risk by the end of the year, taking the potential pandemic-driven cull to 50% of the sector workforce. Airlines report business traffic is still stalled, with only essential worker and government bookings showing some signs of improvement, alongside some parts of the manufacturing sector.

The coronavirus pandemic has forced many consumers to cook and eat at home, hurting the food-service industry. Dining restrictions have squeezed sales and profits of restaurants, forcing thousands to shut down for good. Sysco, which generates more than $50 billion in annual sales as one of the largest food-service distributors in the U.S., said it is using this time to make changes to its business and gain market share.

Mr. Alt will be tasked with managing expenses as consumer demand continues to fluctuate during the pandemic. He will also oversee how Sysco controls inventory of food, payroll and cash flow during the winter, when the company expects pandemic-related restrictions to tighten. In the longer term, the new finance chief will lead efforts to cut costs, win customers and make investments, Mr. Hourican said.

Sysco recently said it will waive order minimums for restaurant customers to help them through the pandemic. Earlier this month, the company said it added $300 million of new business in the latest quarter, while it generated $11.8 billion of sales, a 23% decline from the same period a year earlier. The company also said it remains on track to cut $350 million of costs in fiscal 2021.

In his new role, Mr. Alt is returning to the food business following a nearly three-year stint in the beauty world. He held various roles at Target Corp. for nearly six years before joining Sally Beauty. Before that, he was an executive at Hillshire Brands Co., a packaged-food company that is now part of Tyson Foods Inc.

Mr. Grade, who has worked at Sysco for more than 20 years, was appointed chief financial officer in 2015. In his new role, he will focus on identifying new sources of growth, including deal opportunities, the company said.

"A Wall Street Analyst Says Buy T-Mobile Stock, Sell AT&T, and Hold Verizon. Here's Why. -- Barrons.com","""By almost any financial metric, TMUS is really the only growth story in the relatively mature wireless space,"" Luebchow writes. He has a $150 price target for T-Mobile stock, about 13% above its recent $130.

Verizon's path to future sales growth, meanwhile, will come not from increasing its subscriber base, but from convincing its existing customers to upgrade to more expensive plans, Luebchow expects. Management recently said that about 60% of Verizon subscribers weren't on unlimited plans, and Luebchow estimates that less than 10% are on the highest-tier unlimited plan.

Verizon had the lead in the shift to 4G LTE networks a decade ago, but it lags behind in 5G, Luebchow writes. The company will need to be a big spender at the coming C-Band auction to acquire coveted mid-band spectrum, which offers an attractive trade-off between capacity and range for 5G.

Luebchow expects 2% to 3% annual sales growth from Verizon, and for potential additional growth to come from new 5G-related business lines that further off, such as mobile-edge computing. He initiated Verizon stock at the equivalent of Hold, with a $60 price target -- about where the stock recently traded. It sports a 4.1% annual dividend yield.

AT&T faces the greatest challenges, Luebchow argues. Between a generous dividend, debt-repayment obligations, and the need to invest in areas like 5G infrastructure and new content for HBO Max, there are a lot of demands on the company's cash flows.

""In our view, T is in a difficult position as it struggles to balance investing in its core business segments (wireless, fiber-to-the-home) while deleveraging and paying a sizable dividend,"" Luebchow writes. ""This balancing act is made more difficult by continued declines in legacy business segments (linear TV, enterprise wireline) and the Covid-19 impact on its WarnerMedia business, which will continue to be a headwind into 2021.""

He calls the dividend -- currently yielding 7.2% annually -- safe for the present, but expects the conversation on Wall Street to continue to circle around a potential cut. Luebchow rates AT&T stock at the equivalent of Sell, with a $25 price target. That is 14% below the shares' recent $29.

Luebchow also initiated coverage of United States Cellular (USM). He sees the company's smaller and more regional presence as a competitive disadvantage versus the big three carriers, keeping a lid on growth. But the stock is unfairly discounted, he writes, especially when considering the potential value of U.S. Cellular's tower portfolio. That alone could net $2.3 billion to $3 billion to shareholders in a potential sale -- versus the company's current market capitalization of about $2.7 billion.

Finally, Luebchow expects cable companies including Comcast (CMCSA), Charter Communications (CHTR), and Altice USA (ATUS) to continue gaining subscribers. Each has a wholesale agreement with one or more of the big three carriers for most of its customers' network traffic, meaning they share in that growth. But the cable companies have been exploring ways to move traffic onto their own networks where they have a wired footprint, and have been in recent wireless spectrum auctions.

T-Mobile stock has soared 64% since the start of 2020, versus a 3.5% return including dividends for Verizon, and a 21% loss after dividends for AT&T. U.S. Cellular stock has declined about 12% this year. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average have returned 14% and 5%, respectively, year to date.

Walmart's Sales Gains Slow as Pandemic Drags On -- 2nd Update,"In the U.S., shopper traffic decreased 14.2%, while the value of the average shopping trip increased 24%. People are making fewer trips to Walmart stores, shifting more spending online and stocking up when they do go to stores, the company said. Sales of groceries, paper goods and household cleaning supplies helped boost sales. Demand for parking lot pickup services or home delivery increased.

""We think these new customer behaviors will largely persist and we're well positioned to serve customers with the value and experience they're looking for,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said.

Mr. McMillon congratulated ""President-elect Biden"" on the company's earnings call Tuesday. ""We look forward to working with the administration in both houses of Congress to move the country forward,"" he said. Days after the election, Mr. McMillon also supported the results through his role as head of Business Roundtable.

Coronavirus has upended the retail landscape, allowing some retailers to thrive as more spending shifts to household basics and home improvements. Others such as department stores and apparel retailers have been hurt by temporary closures early in the pandemic and people buying less clothes for work or going out.

Retail sales increased a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in October from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. It was the sixth straight month of gains but the pace of growth slowed. Stimulus funds ran out for many unemployed Americans.

On Tuesday, Home Depot Inc. said its comparable sales jumped 24.1% in the third quarter, but higher costs depressed its profits. Shoppers stuck at home are using money typically spent on restaurants or travel to spruce up their surroundings. Competitor Lowe's Cos. reports earnings Wednesday.

Kohl's Corp., a department store chain, reported its comparable store and online sales fell 13.3% in the third quarter. The sales drop was less severe than the second quarter and Kohl's said it would reinstitute its cash dividend in 2021. Rival Macy's Inc. reports results Thursday.

Shares of Walmart rose 2% in premarket trading while Home Depot fell nearly 2%. Both shares have climbed more than 25% so far this year. Kohl's shares, down nearly 50% on the year, slipped 2% premarket.

""Within Walmart's results are some mixed trends,"" said John Zolidis, president and retail analyst at Quo Vadis Capital. ""Clearly commerce has accelerated, but we can also see traffic was down 14% for the second consecutive quarter and that's a big number."" Mr. Zolidis gave Walmart a ""sell"" rating last month, saying that it will be hard for the retailer to upstage its current results next year.

Walmart executives said foot traffic and grocery market share are improving as it extends its stores' hours. Early in the pandemic, Walmart reduced hours, often closing at 8:30 p.m., to give workers more time to clean and stock shelves. In recent weeks it extended opening hours to 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. in most stores and plans to add back more hours, executives said on a conference call Tuesday.

Walmart has tried to ramp up its online offerings by rolling out grocery pickup and delivery services at more than half its 4,700 U.S. stores. It has also introduced the Walmart+ membership program that gives free delivery for $98 annual fee. The company didn't say how many people have signed up for the service.

The company has also invested in e-commerce operations in the U.S., adding marketplace services and expanding its own selection to compete with Amazon.com Inc. In its September quarter, Amazon's revenue soared 37% to a record $96.2 billion and its profit tripled to $6.3 billion, propelled by both online shopping and its lucrative cloud-computing arm.

While Walmart still is larger in terms of total revenue, Amazon's profit eclipsed Walmart's haul in the latest period.

Walmart reported total revenue of $134.71 billion for the quarter ended Oct. 31, up 5.2% from the year ago quarter. It had a profit of $5.14 billion, compared with $3.29 billion last year. The latest period included $400 million in additional Covid-related expenses, a loss on the Argentina unit sale and a gain on the value of its stake in China's JD.com.

The retailer has been pruning its bricks-and-mortar locations in slower growth countries outside the U.S. During the latest quarter, Walmart agreed to sell its Asda chain in the U.K. and its stores in Argentina. This week, it struck a deal to sell its stores in Japan -- 18 years after entering the island country.

Berkshire Hathaway Invests in Drugmakers Seeking Covid-19 Vaccine -- 2nd Update,"Berkshire made these investments sometime in the quarter ended Sept. 30, well before Pfizer, BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc. reported positive results from late-stage trials of potential vaccines.

""Historically, Buffett has stated that, if he were to invest in the pharmaceutical industry, it would likely be that he takes a basket approach and buys a handful of companies instead of a very large stake in just one,"" Berkshire investor and Cheviot Value Management LLC portfolio manager Darren Pollock wrote in a note.

Mr. Buffett generally invests in stable industries he expects to grow over time, suggesting he expects the broader pharmaceutical world to profit from eventual Covid-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Berkshire's recent investments give insight into how he believes the coronavirus pandemic will shape American businesses for the long term.

Overall, Berkshire's largest stock investments remain Apple Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Coca-Cola Co.

The 90-year-old Mr. Buffett might or might not have made these investments himself. Berkshire employs two portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who make many of Berkshire's equities investment decisions. When Mr. Buffett eventually steps down from running Berkshire, Messrs. Combs and Weschler are on the shortlist of potential successors, along with two vice chairmen: Greg Abel and Ajit Jain.

The purchases come after Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its airline holdings earlier this year as the pandemic struck. In May, Mr. Buffett disclosed Berkshire had sold its stakes in United Airlines Holdings Inc., American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co.

""The airline business has the problem that if the business comes back 70% or 80%, the aircraft don't disappear,"" he said during Berkshire's virtual annual meeting. ""The world changed for airlines.""

Berkshire unloaded more bank stocks in the third quarter.

The conglomerate roughly halved its remaining stake in Wells Fargo & Co., further whittling down its holdings in a bank it has owned for more than three decades. Berkshire also sold nearly all of its remaining stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co. The moves continue the billions of dollars worth of sales of both firms in the second quarter.

Meanwhile, Bank of America appears to be emerging as Mr. Buffett's favorite bank. His firm increased its share holdings by about 9% last quarter. Berkshire now owns nearly 12% of the company, according to FactSet, above the 10% threshold Mr. Buffett has said he typically tops out at.

Berkshire has also invested heavily in its own stocks in the first three quarters of the year, making $15.7 billion in stock buybacks. These buybacks rank among the largest investments Berkshire has ever made.

Investors and analysts continue to wait for Mr. Buffett to spend a larger chunk of Berkshire's $150 billion cash pile on an acquisition or a significant stake in a company. In recent months Berkshire purchased Dominion Energy Inc.'s midstream energy business and invested $6 billion in five Japanese companies.

""The portfolio has really taken on a new economy look,"" said James Shanahan, senior equity research analyst at Edward Jones.

Last quarter, Berkshire invested almost $276 million in T-Mobile US Inc.

Mr. Shanahan said the portfolio has become more balanced with more technology and telecommunications positions in recent years and reduced exposure to financial services.

SANTA ROSA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 17, 2020-- 

Keysight Technologies, Inc . (NYSE: KEYS), a leading technology company that helps enterprises, service providers and governments accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world, has introduced a new performance test solution that enables mobile operators to automatically benchmark and evaluate performance of 5G new radio (NR) devices and base stations in a laboratory environment.

Keysight's Performance Benchmarking Solution for Lab Networks enables mobile operators to flexibly, confidently and cost-effectively evaluate how 5G devices and 5G bases stations will perform in a live 5G NR network environment as new models, features and versions become available. The versatile test solution combines Keysight's Nemo Outdoor 5G NR Drive Test Solution, Nemo 5G Device Analytics software, and PathWave Test Automation, a test sequencer built on OpenTAP, an open source test automation engine, and complemented with a wide range of test cases to create an automated test environment.

""We're pleased to support mobile operators with an automated performance test solution that reduces time to market, while maintaining high quality standards, compared to manual processes,"" said Petri Toljamo, vice president and general manager for Nemo wireless solutions at Keysight. ""Frequent updates to devices and base stations, as well as the introduction of new models and versions, require a simple, workflow-connected solution that generates a single performance score for each device or base station under test.""

Keysight's 5G Performance Benchmarking Solution for Lab Networks enables mobile operators to: 


   -- Evaluate multiple devices in a single test campaign using live base 
      stations 
 
   -- Evaluate a 5G base station (gNodeB) using a reference 5G device 
 
   -- Compile key performance indicators (KPIs) across multiple test cases to 
      generate a single score, reinforcing objective comparisons between the 
      different models or versions under test 
 
   -- Access a single user interface for test plan execution, analysis, report 
      generation and access to historical records 
 
   -- Expand test campaigns and evaluate advanced scenarios such as mobility by 
      using OpenTAP and attenuators 

""Keysight's integrated solutions improve test automation and accelerate performance evaluation in a test laboratory environment prior to deployment enables Erillisverkot to provide secure and reliable information and communications technology (ICT) services to public authorities,"" said Antti Kauppinen, head of department, mobile technology development and strategy, Erillisverkot Group. ""Thorough and continuous testing of devices and network elements with new features and updates guarantees a smooth roll-out.""

Users can combine Keysight's Performance Benchmarking Solution for Lab Networks with the company's 5G Device Benchmarking Toolset, a first-to-market solution launched in March 2020, to verify devices using Keysight's UXM 5G wireless test platform, a network emulator.

Veracyte Announces New General Manager Structure to Advance Global Expansion 


SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 17, 2020-- 

Veracyte (Nasdaq: VCYT) today announced a new general manager-based structure to advance the company's growing roster of genomic tests and its global expansion. John Hanna , currently chief commercial officer, will become GM, endocrinology, breast cancer and lymphoma. The company also announced that Morten Frost will join the company as GM, pulmonology. Both executives will assume their new roles January 1, 2021.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201117005508/en/ 

Morten Frost appointed GM, Pulmonology, at Veracyte

""Veracyte is undergoing exciting growth, including our transformation into a global diagnostics company, our growing menu of genomic tests in a range of diseases, and our planned launch next year of four new products,"" said Bonnie Anderson, Veracyte 's chairman and chief executive officer. ""Our new GM-based structure will optimally position us to serve our growing customer base, manage our products throughout their life cycles to ensure long-term strategic growth and further empower our executive leaders and employees throughout the organization.""

The new general managers will have global responsibility and accountability for their respective indications from strategic business planning to tactical execution, including pipeline development, strategy, marketing, sales, reimbursement and field-based medical affairs.

John Hanna will continue to drive growth for Veracyte 's flagship Afirma business in thyroid cancer and will assume leadership over the company's growing global Prosigna business in breast cancer, which together represent approximately 90 percent of revenue today. He will also lead the company's lymphoma business, with the launch of its LymphMark subtyping test scheduled for next year. Mr. Hanna joined Veracyte in 2011 and has held several leadership roles during his tenure. Since he became chief commercial officer in 2017, the company's genomic test volume and revenue have doubled.

Morten Frost will join Veracyte to lead its lung cancer portfolio strategy, including the launch next year of the company's nasal swab test and Percepta Atlas, and will also drive the global introduction in 2021 of the Envisia classifier, for use in interstitial lung disease diagnosis, on the nCounter Analysis System. Mr. Frost comes to Veracyte with significant strategic consulting, sales and marketing experience. He was most recently at Agilent Technologies , where he served as head of global marketing for the company's pathology and companion diagnostics business, which are part of Agilent 's approximately $1 billion Diagnostics and Genomics Group. In this role, he drove significant revenue growth, global product launches, biopharmaceutical partnerships and M&A strategy.

""I could not be more pleased to have executives of John's and Morten's caliber leading our product businesses at this exciting moment in our company's growth,"" said Ms. Anderson. ""John's leadership has been critical to Veracyte 's success to date and will be key to further driving revenue growth across multiple indications in the United States and globally. I am also thrilled that Morten is joining Veracyte to further strengthen our leadership team. He is an exceptional market strategist who will be critical to driving our pulmonology business forward, particularly in lung cancer, where we estimate our current and pipeline products target an addressable market of approximately $40 billion.""

Walmart CEO Congratulates President-elect Biden -- Market Talk,"0847 ET - US benchmark oil prices decline early in NY as investors worry new coronavirus restrictions in some parts of the US could reverse improving US gasoline demand that stands as just 10% below year-ago levels vs a nearly 50% drop in April. WTI crude burst 3% higher on Monday after reports of another promising Covid vaccine, but final approval and broad distribution could take weeks or months. Meantime, rising coronavirus cases are leading to new restrictions in places like New York, while Oregon and New Mexico have ordered near lockdowns. The market's also waiting to hear more about OPEC 's plans to keep output cuts going. WTI falls 1.6% to $40.69 a barrel. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

0824 ET - PepsiCo names Pietro Antonio Tataranni chief medical officer, another example of how the coronavirus has pushed them to focus on executives related to health. For example, Tyson Foods and Royal Caribbean Cruises have also created chief medical officer positions. PepsiCo says Tataranni, who joined the beverage and snack giant in 2018 and has served in executive roles focused on science, will ""will continue to oversee all aspects of the company's efforts to protect its global workforce, products and communities in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic"" and also work on science-related issues.

0804 ET - US stock futures trade lower after major indexes closed at record highs on Monday on optimism surrounding new coronavirus vaccines. Shares gained Monday after Moderna said its experimental vaccine has proven 94.5% effective at protecting people from Covid-19, following strong trial results from Pfizer and partner BioNTech last week. But caution remains as new infections continue to rise across the country and the timing of vaccine approval and distribution remains uncertain. Tesla shares climb 12% premarket as the electric-car maker gets set to be added to the S&P 500 index on Dec. 21.

0726 ET - Some companies are finding reason to send more cash to shareholders through dividend payments or are planning to do so even as Covid-19 pandemic persists. Tyson Foods said yesterday its board increased its annualized dividend rates to $1.78 and $1.602 a share for two classes of shares. Costco Wholesale declared a special cash dividend of $10 a share on Monday. And retailer Kohl's says this morning it expects to reinstate a cash payout to shareholders during 1H of 2021. When the coronavirus first spread, companies drew down credit lines, suspended dividend payments and stock buybacks and took other measures to preserve cash. But visibility has improved for many firms. (micah.maidenberg@wsj.com; @MicahMaidenberg)

Walmart's Sales Gains Slow as Pandemic Drags On -- Update,"In the U.S., shopper traffic decreased 14.2%, while the value of the average shopping trip increased 24%. People are making fewer trips to Walmart stores, shifting more spending online and stocking up when they do go to stores, the company said. Sales of groceries, paper goods and household cleaning supplies helped boost sales. Demand for parking lot pickup services or home delivery increased.

""We think these new customer behaviors will largely persist and we're well positioned to serve customers with the value and experience they're looking for,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said.

Coronavirus has upended the retail landscape, allowing some retailers to thrive as more spending shifts to household basics and home improvements. Others such as department stores and apparel retailers have been hurt by temporary closures early in the pandemic and people buying less clothes for work or going out.

On Tuesday, Home Depot Inc. said its comparable sales jumped 24.1% in the third quarter, but higher costs depressed its profits. Shoppers stuck at home are using money typically spent on restaurants or travel to spruce up their surroundings. Competitor Lowe's Cos. reports earnings Wednesday.

Shares of Walmart rose 2% in premarket trading while Home Depot fell nearly 2%. Both shares have climbed more than 25% so far this year.

""Within Walmart's results are some mixed trends,"" said John Zolidis, president and retail analyst at Quo Vadis Capital. ""Clearly commerce has accelerated, but we can also see traffic was down 14% for the second consecutive quarter and that's a big number."" Mr. Zolidis gave Walmart a ""sell"" rating last month, saying that it will be hard for the retailer to upstage its current results next year.

Walmart has tried to ramp up its online offerings by rolling out grocery pickup and delivery services at more than half its 4,700 U.S. stores. It has also introduced the Walmart+ membership program that gives free delivery for $98 annual fee. The company didn't say how many people have signed up for the service.

The company has also invested in e-commerce operations in the U.S., adding marketplace services and expanding its own selection to compete with Amazon.com Inc. In its September quarter, Amazon's revenue soared 37% to a record $96.2 billion and its profit tripled to $6.3 billion, propelled by both online shopping and its lucrative cloud-computing arm.

While Walmart still is larger in terms of total revenue, Amazon's profit eclipsed Walmart's haul in the latest period.

Walmart reported total revenue of $134.71 billion for the quarter ended Oct. 31, up 5.2% from the year ago quarter. It had a profit of $5.14 billion, compared with $3.29 billion last year. The latest period included $400 million in additional Covid-related expenses, a loss on the Argentina unit sale and a gain on the value of its stake in China's JD.com.

The retailer has been pruning its bricks-and-mortar locations in slower growth countries outside the U.S. During the latest quarter, Walmart agreed to sell its Asda chain in the U.K. and its stores in Argentina. This week, it struck a deal to sell its stores in Japan -- 18 years after entering the island country.

*S&PGR Rates American Tower Corp.'s Prpsd Snr Unsecd Nts 'BBB-',"
 
 
The following is a press release from S&P Global Ratings: 
 
NEW YORK (S&P Global Ratings) Nov. 17, 2020--S&P Global Ratings today assigned 
its 'BBB-' issue-level rating to Boston-based wireless tower operator American 
Tower Corp.'s proposed senior unsecured notes due 2024, 2028, and 2051 (amount 
and allocations to be determined). 
 
The company will use the proceeds from these notes to repay the approximately 
$550 million of outstanding borrowings under its $2.35 billion revolving 
credit facility due in 2025 and for general corporate purposes, which may 
include funding acquisitions. Following the transaction, the company will have 
full availability under the revolving credit facility, which it could also use 
to fund acquisitions. 
 
Our 'BBB-' issuer credit rating and stable outlook on American Tower remain 
unchanged because the transaction is leverage neutral. We expect the company's 
adjusted leverage will be in the high-5x area in 2020 pro forma for its $3.5 
billion acquisition of Virginia-based InSite Wireless Group LLC (unrated), 
which it announced earlier this month. 
 
For our view of the InSite Wireless acquisition, please see our most recent 
bulletin on American Tower, published Nov. 5, 2020, on RatingsDirect.

Such statements involve uncertainties that could significantly impact our financial results. Words such as ""expects,"" ""anticipates,"" ""intends,"" ""plans,"" ""believes,"" ""seeks,"" and ""estimates,"" including variations of such words and similar expressions, are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature.

Walmart's Earnings Were Impressive. Why Its Stock Is Slipping. -- Barrons.com,"Same-store sales rose 6.4%, ahead of the 4% consensus estimate. The company said sales climbed across categories, while e-commerce soared 79%, also seeing broad-based strength. Comparable sales at its discount unit Sam's Club were up 11.1%, while e-commerce sales grew 41%. Membership income increased 10.4%.

Walmart stock was initially higher after the report, but drifted lower, along with Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 futures, and was down 1.4% to $150.35 around 9 a.m. Eastern time.

Part of that might be the market's general mood. However, there were some items to nitpick in the report. Overall revenue growth, same-store sales growth, and e-commerce growth slowed from second-quarter levels, and the company didn't provide much in the way of detail about its new Walmart+ subscription service, which investors may have been hoping for.

Still, those factors were largely overshadowed by good news. Not only did top- and bottom-line results beat expectations, comparable sales -- the weak point in the second quarter -- showed improvement each month of the quarter, a promising trend.

While traffic was down 14.2% in the period, customers spent 24% more when they did shop, and clearly shifted some spending online. That echoes patterns of trip consolidation evident earlier this year at a number of retailers. Gross margins expanded 0.5 percentage point, roughly double what analysts expected.

The company said Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart was a driver of Walmart International sales, helped by a record number of monthly active users, the first time it has highlighted the division in this way -- though it has been a boon for some time.

""These strong results are wholly consistent with the trend that we're seeing -- the U.S. consumer is in the middle of the largest shift in shopping behavior in the last 50 years, as convenience and safety increase in importance and e-commerce grows more rapidly than ever,"" said Hilding Anderson, Head of Retail Strategy, North America at Publicis Sapient. ""Companies, like Walmart, that have prioritized investments in digital channels and have made serious strides with their digital strategies are acquiring and retaining a new set of customers, and will ultimately be the winners in this new era of retail, becoming a serious threat to those who have lagged behind.""

Press Release: AES and AIMCo to Form Leading Renewables Platform in the US,"PR Newswire

ARLINGTON, Va., Nov. 17, 2020

ARLINGTON, Va., Nov. 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) today announced an agreement with Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo ) to merge the sPower development platform, a leading independent solar developer in the US, with AES ' US-based clean energy development business to accelerate the safe, reliable transition to cleaner energy solutions in the country. AES ' wholly-owned clean energy development business includes AES Distributed Energy and a wind development team formerly part of Advance Energy. The merged business will represent one of the top renewables growth platforms.

As states, communities and organizations of all types make commitments and plans to reduce their carbon footprints, renewables are on track to be the fastest-growing source of electricity generation in the US in 2020. AES is working with its customers to co-create and deliver the smarter, greener energy solutions that meet their needs, including 24/7 carbon-free energy.

""We share our customers' commitments to a more sustainable energy future. Together, we can create a safe, resilient and carbon-free grid,"" said Andrés Gluski , AES President and Chief Executive Officer. ""The merger of sPower with AES ' clean energy business will benefit customers by providing access to a broader portfolio of product offerings as well as an expanded highly skilled and experienced team to drive innovation at scale.""

""sPower has been one of our key infrastructure platforms since our initial investment made in partnership with AES in 2017,"" stated Kevin Uebelein , Chief Executive Officer of AIMCo. ""Our experience working with AES has shown that they are a world leader in delivering on customers' sustainable energy needs, and the formation of this new renewables platform in the US will take that capability to an even higher level. On behalf of our clients and consistent with our investment mandate, we are excited about the value the next phase of our partnership will bring to our many stakeholders.""

The merged renewables platform will bring together sPower's and AES ' differentiated capabilities in solar, wind and energy storage to accelerate our customers' energy transitions.

""This platform will bring tremendous value to our customers as they pursue their business objectives and climate commitments,"" said Leo Moreno, AES Clean Energy President. ""Our expanded portfolio of innovative solutions based on cutting-edge technologies will enable us to work together with our customers to power their energy transitions while making a carbon-free future possible.""

Future projects developed from the combined 12 gigawatts (GW) development pipeline will be owned 75% by AES and 25% by AIMCo, leveraging our successful partnership at sPower. Although there is no change in ownership of operating assets and backlog, the newly formed platform will manage the 2.5 GW of operating assets and the existing 2.6 GW contracted backlog. The transaction is expected to close in the next few months upon successful completion of customary closing conditions.

PNC Financial Will Be A Regional No More,"The $11.6 billion deal agreement flows from PNC's sale of its stake in BlackRock earlier this year, which pulled in $11.1 billion after tax. By paying all cash, PNC is in effect swapping out the BlackRock stake, which generated good returns but didn't add much strategically, for a major expansion of its core business.

Some investors may have been dreaming that a bank with $10 billion to play with could radically rethink the whole concept of banking, perhaps with a huge bet on tech. But many big banks are still finding that core relationship banking and branches, even in a scaled-back form, remain part of the playbook to grow truly profitable customers. That may be particularly so in commercial banking, where PNC will be tilted after the deal.

Instead, investors should think about what PNC is aiming to redefine, which is the ""regional bank"" appellation. By adding BBVA in places like Texas, the Sun Belt and California to PNC's eastern center of gravity, postdeal the bank would be in 29 of the top 30 U.S. metropolitan statistical areas, up from 22.

So even if it is a different kind of bank, far more ""Main Street"" than ""Wall Street,"" it is more national in footprint than Citigroup, for example, along some dimensions. It may also be more national than some peers in asset size among ""regionals,"" such as U.S. Bank or Truist that have regional branch gaps on the East Coast or West Coast, respectively.

Given the government scrutiny of every bank deal, there is further logic to such an expansion. For a bank like PNC already well above a key threshold of $250 billion in assets, its ultimate capital ratio requirements typically depend more on its mix of business than its size. If PNC had added, say, an investment bank with a big trading desk, it might have ended up facing more stringent capital requirements due to its complexity or riskiness than it would by adding a large amount of the same type of banking in more regions.

PNC is betting that the best way to add returns at a time of historically low rates is to bet on applying its operational know-how, including cost reduction and an improved technology backbone. It estimates that it can generate a 19% internal rate of return on the deal, which is likely better than banks are typically getting on just deploying their capital in lending these days.

PNC estimates about 21% accretion to its earnings-per-share by 2022. Investors may want to keep an eye on return on equity, too. PNC projects a postdeal return on common equity of 10.5% in 2022. That is about what analysts are projecting for this year, at 10.6%, according to Visible Alpha, and shy of last year at over 11%. But it is still much more than analysts were forecasting for 2022, which is under 10%.

So at a time when returns to risk from lending money are low, the returns to taking business risk are relatively better. That may not be radical, but if well-executed it could still be lucrative.

Walmart's Sales Gains Slow as Pandemic Drags On -- 3rd Update,"In the U.S., shopper traffic decreased 14.2%, while the value of the average shopping trip increased 24%. People are making fewer trips to Walmart stores, shifting more spending online and stocking up when they do go to stores, the company said. Sales of groceries, paper goods and household cleaning supplies helped boost sales. Demand for parking lot pickup services or home delivery increased.

""When the pandemic hit, we were hit hard from an out-of-stock standpoint and it sent traffic into other retailers,"" Walmart finance chief Brett Biggs said in an interview. In-stock levels have since improved, he said. ""Over time that works its way back, as people get back to what the new normal looks like.""

Coronavirus has upended the retail landscape, allowing some retailers to thrive as more spending shifts to household basics and home improvements. Others such as department stores and apparel retailers have been hurt by temporary closures early in the pandemic and people buying less clothes for work or going out.

""Changes in customer behavior have accelerated the shift to e-commerce and digital. We were well positioned to catch and ride these waves given our previous work and investments,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on a call Tuesday.

Retail sales increased a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in October from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. It was the sixth straight month of gains but the pace of growth slowed. Stimulus funds ran out for many unemployed Americans.

On Tuesday, Home Depot Inc. said its comparable sales jumped 24.1% in the third quarter, but higher costs depressed its profits. Shoppers stuck at home are using money typically spent on restaurants or travel to spruce up their surroundings. Competitor Lowe's Cos. reports earnings Wednesday.

Kohl's Corp., a department store chain, reported its comparable store and online sales fell 13.3% in the third quarter. The sales drop was less severe than the second quarter and Kohl's said it would reinstitute its cash dividend in 2021. Rival Macy's Inc. reports results Thursday.

Shares of Walmart were flat in late morning trading Tuesday while Home Depot fell nearly 3%. Both shares have climbed more than 25% so far this year and were near all-time highs. Kohl's shares, down nearly 50% on the year, gained about 5%.

""Within Walmart's results are some mixed trends,"" said John Zolidis, president and retail analyst at Quo Vadis Capital. ""Clearly commerce has accelerated, but we can also see traffic was down 14% for the second consecutive quarter and that's a big number."" Mr. Zolidis gave Walmart a ""sell"" rating last month, saying that it will be hard for the retailer to upstage its current results next year.

Walmart executives said foot traffic and grocery market share are improving as it extends its stores' hours and improves its in-stock levels. Early in the pandemic, Walmart reduced hours, often closing at 8:30 p.m., instead of staying open 24 hours a day, to give workers more time to clean and stock shelves. In recent weeks it extended opening hours to 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. in most stores and plans to add back more hours, executives said on a conference call Tuesday.

Walmart's traffic is falling more than some competitors because most rivals weren't open 24 hours a day before the pandemic. ""That comparison will be really different than our competitors who don't stay open 24 hours a day,"" Mr. Biggs, the CFO, said.

""While it's still early in the quarter, with big sales days in front of us, we expect it to be a good holiday season,"" Mr. Biggs said.

Walmart has tried to ramp up its online offerings by rolling out grocery pickup and delivery services at more than half its 4,700 U.S. stores. It has also introduced the Walmart+ membership program that gives free delivery for a $98 annual fee. The company didn't say how many people have signed up for the service.

The company has also invested in e-commerce operations in the U.S., adding marketplace services and expanding its own selection to compete with Amazon.com Inc. In its September quarter, Amazon's revenue soared 37% to a record $96.2 billion and its profit tripled to $6.3 billion, propelled by both online shopping and its lucrative cloud-computing arm.

While Walmart still is larger in terms of total revenue, Amazon's profit eclipsed Walmart's haul in the latest period. On Tuesday, Amazon moved further into Walmart's turf with an online pharmacy service.

Walmart reported total revenue of $134.71 billion for the quarter ended Oct. 31, up 5.2% from the year ago quarter. It had a profit of $5.14 billion, compared with $3.29 billion last year. The latest period included $400 million in additional Covid-related expenses, a loss on the Argentina unit sale and a gain on the value of its stake in China's JD.com.

The retailer has been pruning its bricks-and-mortar locations in slower growth countries outside the U.S. During the latest quarter, Walmart agreed to sell its Asda chain in the U.K. and its stores in Argentina. This week, it struck a deal to sell its stores in Japan -- 18 years after entering the island country.

Mr. McMillon congratulated President-elect Biden on the company's earnings call Tuesday. ""We look forward to working with the administration in both houses of Congress to move the country forward,"" the Walmart CEO said. Days after the election Mr. McMillon also supported the results through his role as head of Business Roundtable.

Providers of customer-relationship management software in recent weeks have...,"Since the beginning of October, Salesforce.com Inc. and Oracle Corp. embedded additional AI predictive capabilities into their CRM systems. SAP SE acquired Emarsys, a company with an AI-embedded marketing platform. And C3.ai Inc., Adobe Inc., and Microsoft Corp. brought out a line of CRM systems, called C3 AI CRM, designed for specific industries, such as financial services, manufacturing, and utilities.

Artificial intelligence can help sales teams better spot leads, market products and reduce customer churn, Mr. Purcell said.

U.S. Bank, whose parent is Minneapolis-based lender U.S. Bancorp, said customer behavior has changed during the pandemic, with less foot traffic in branches and more online banking. It is relying more on AI, and the machine-learning capabilities in Salesforce's CRM, to identify patterns in customer activity. It is looking at customers' profiles, balances, transactions and other data to spot people who might be open to doing more business, as well as those who might be leaving the bank. U.S. Bank said the software has helped on both fronts, but declined to quantify the benefit.

The bank has been anticipating an increase in digital banking, said Kai Sakstrup, U.S. Bank's chief strategy officer, but Covid-19 accelerated the trend.

Salesforce is the CRM applications software market leader, followed by SAP and Oracle, according to International Data Corp.

The world-wide market for CRM application software market is projected to go from $60.29 billion in 2019 to $61.95 billion this year, a 2.75% increase, according to IDC, which expects the market to grow at a 7.1% compound annual growth rate over the next few years. Overall IT spending is expected to show year-over-year growth of just 0.3%, to $2.34 trillion, in 2020, the technology research firm said.

IDC said AI CRM application revenue will reach $48.3 billion in 2024, up from $24.6 billion in 2020. Tom Siebel, chairman and chief executive officer of artificial intelligence company C3.ai, said the current demand ""is staggering.""

""The next generation of CRM,"" he said, ""is all about AI-enabled CRM.""

C3 AI CRM combines Microsoft's Dynamics 365 CRM product, Adobe's Experience Cloud customer-experience application and C3.ai's AI engine, which analyzes sales data to help businesses identify high-quality prospects, predict demand, forecast revenue, and target their marketing efforts.

Salesforce last month added to its CRM an AI tool that analyzes the content of email and push messages before they're sent to assess the likelihood that customers will open the message and click on a link or take another action. This followed the introduction in June of an AI call-coaching tool, which analyzes transcripts of sales representatives' calls and suggests better ways to sell based on a collection of best practices and resources.

Oracle earlier this month added a new feature to Oracle CX Sales that's designed to generate a probability score for how likely a prospective deal is to close. Machine learning analyzes the actions of a corporate prospect, such as past purchases and the number and length of product demonstrations the customer watched.

""Our overall development cycles on AI infused features is faster now than it was two years ago,"" said Rob Tarkoff, executive vice president and general manager of Oracle Cloud CX and Data Cloud.

At SAP, Adrian Nash, head of strategy for SAP Customer Experience, said the newly acquired Emarsys platform will work with SAP's Sales Cloud CRM package.

And Microsoft in the last two months added to its Dynamics 365 suite AI tools for predicting customer churn and routing customer-call requests to the proper team.

Walmart Rethinks Global Footprint --- Retail giant's sale of stake in Japan chain helps sharpen new focus on e-commerce,"Walmart has sold three longtime overseas holdings in less than seven weeks, each at the cost of some financial pain. In October, the Bentonville, Ark., giant agreed to sell U.K. grocery-store chain Asda Group Ltd. to a private investment group in a deal valuing Asda at the equivalent of $8.8 billion. Walmart said it expected to recognize a noncash after-tax loss of about $2.5 billion. And on Nov. 6, Walmart said it would sell its retail operations in Argentina in a deal that would result in a noncash after-tax loss of about $1 billion.

Walmart executives in early 2018 said the retail behemoth would back away from slow growth and struggling international operations, in favor of higher-growth or e-commerce opportunities. Since then it has gradually remade its international operations, including buying Indian e-commerce startup Flipkart for $16 billion and investing in e-commerce operations in Canada and Mexico.

The rapid shift to online shopping around the world because of the Covid-19 pandemic also played a role in Walmart's decision to sell its Japanese operations, a company spokesman said Monday. Rakuten already has e-commerce infrastructure in place and is able to ramp up quickly to meet customer expectations, said the spokesman. ""A partnership like this just makes more sense for the business,"" he said.

The pandemic has also helped grocery stores and may have made it easier for Walmart to find buyers.

""It's been a big tailwind because more people are staying home and eating out less,"" said Eiji Yatagawa, a partner at KKR. ""The purchase amount per visit has also gone up because they are trying to go out less frequently.""

Two years ago, Walmart sold most of its Brazilian operations in another deal that left it with losses. The retailer retains a big bricks-and-mortar presence in some places, including China, Mexico and Central America.

Walmart's biggest overseas bet in recent years was in e-commerce: Its purchase of roughly 77% of Flipkart was its largest-ever acquisition.

Walmart's method of achieving dominance in the U.S. -- squeezing out supply-chain inefficiencies and getting the best price from suppliers -- often failed to translate in overseas markets such as Japan.

After first investing in Seiyu in 2002, Walmart ultimately spent more than $2 billion to take 100% control of the perennial money loser by 2008. Seiyu stopped reporting its results after that, but other Japanese big-box stores selling daily necessities such as groceries and household items have been suffering. Government filings from Walmart's Japan holding company, Seiyu's direct parent, have shown virtually no net income in recent years.

KKR's Mr. Yatagawa said the involvement of Rakuten, whose e-commerce businesses in Japan compete with Amazon.com Inc., will help Seiyu offer a combination of online and offline shopping. And Seiyu, he said, will be able make faster, more localized business decisions under private-equity management than under Walmart.

Berkshire Invests in Drugmakers Seeking Covid-19 Vaccine,"Berkshire made these investments sometime in the quarter ended Sept. 30, well before Pfizer, BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc. reported positive results from late-stage trials of potential vaccines.

“Historically, Buffett has stated that, if he were to invest in the pharmaceutical industry, it would likely be that he takes a basket approach and buys a handful of companies instead of a very large stake in just one,” Berkshire investor and Cheviot Value Management LLC portfolio manager Darren Pollockwrote in a note.

Mr. Buffett generally invests in stable industries he expects to grow over time, suggesting he expects the broader pharmaceutical world to profit from eventual Covid-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Berkshire’s recent investments give insight into how he believes the coronavirus pandemic will shape American businesses for the long term.

Overall, Berkshire’s largest stock investments remain Apple Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Coca-Cola Co.

The 90-year-old Mr. Buffett might or might not have made these investments himself. Berkshire employs two portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who make many of Berkshire’s equities investment decisions. When Mr. Buffett eventually steps down from running Berkshire, they are on the shortlist of potential successors, along with Greg Abel and Ajit Jain.

The purchases come after Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its airline holdings earlier this year as the pandemic struck. In May, Mr. Buffett disclosed Berkshire had sold its stakes in United Airlines Holdings Inc., American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co.

“The airline business has the problem that if the business comes back 70% or 80%, the aircraft don’t disappear,” he said during Berkshire’s virtual annual meeting. “The world changed for airlines.”

Berkshire unloaded more bank stocks in the third quarter.

The conglomerate roughly halved its remaining stake in Wells Fargo & Co., further whittling down its holdings in a bank it has owned for more than three decades. Berkshire also sold nearly all of its remaining stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co. The moves continue the billions of dollars worth of sales of both firms in the second quarter.

Meanwhile, Bank of America appears to be emerging as Mr. Buffett’s favorite bank. His firm increased its share holdings by about 9% last quarter. Berkshire now owns nearly 12% of the company, according to FactSet, above the 10% threshold Mr. Buffett has said he typically tops out at.

Berkshire has also invested heavily in its own stocks in the first three quarters of the year, making $15.7 billion in stock buybacks. These buybacks rank among the largest investments Berkshire has ever made.

Investors and analysts continue to wait for Mr. Buffett to spend a larger chunk of Berkshire’s $150 billion cash pile on an acquisition or a significant stake in a company. In recent months Berkshire purchased Dominion Energy Inc.’s midstream energy business and invested $6 billion in five Japanese companies.

“The portfolio has really taken on a new economy look,” said James Shanahan, senior equity research analyst at Edward Jones.

Last quarter, Berkshire invested almost $276 million in T-Mobile US Inc.

Mr. Shanahan said the portfolio has become more balanced with more technology and telecommunications positions in recent years and reduced exposure to financial services.

Berkshire unloaded more bank stocks in the third quarter.

The conglomerate roughly halved its remaining stake in Wells Fargo & Co., further whittling down its holdings in a bank it has owned for more than three decades. Berkshire also sold nearly all of its remaining stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co. The moves continue the billions of dollars worth of sales of both firms in the second quarter.

Meanwhile, Bank of America appears to be emerging as Mr. Buffett’s favorite bank. His firm increased its share holdings by about 9% last quarter. Berkshire now owns nearly 12% of the company, according to FactSet, above the 10% threshold Mr. Buffett has said he typically tops out at.

Berkshire has also invested heavily in its own stocks in the first three quarters of the year, making $15.7 billion in stock buybacks. These buybacks rank among the largest investments Berkshire has ever made.

Investors and analysts continue to wait for Mr. Buffett to spend a larger chunk of Berkshire’s $150 billion cash pile on an acquisition or a significant stake in a company. In recent months Berkshire purchased Dominion Energy Inc.’s midstream energy business and invested $6 billion in five Japanese companies.

“The portfolio has really taken on a new economy look,” said James Shanahan, senior equity research analyst at Edward Jones.

Last quarter, Berkshire invested almost $276 million in T-Mobile US Inc.

Mr. Shanahan said the portfolio has become more balanced with more technology and telecommunications positions in recent years and reduced exposure to financial services.

Goldman Tech Guru Jumps to Dell's Firm,"He will be chief executive of MSD Partners, which manages about $15 billion including some of Mr. Dell's fortune and has plans to grow.

The 51-year-old joined Goldman in 1992 and spent his career as a counselor to big technology and media companies including Twitter Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. He was named in 2013 a co-head of its merger business and promoted again in 2017 to co-run its investment-banking arm, which includes M&A, IPOs and lending deals. A former Dartmouth soccer goalie, he remains a sports nut -- he and Goldman's president, John Waldron, share a box at Fenway Park -- and is well-liked on Wall Street.

Though he had been seen as a potential candidate to be CEO, the bid was a long-shot one -- current CEO David Solomon is just two years into the job -- and Mr. Lemkau has flirted with jobs in private equity over the years. He informed Mr. Solomon of his decision over the summer, according to people familiar with the matter, and stayed on through Goldman's selection of new partners, who were named last week.

He knows Mr. Dell well, having advised on a decade's worth of deals that took his eponymous computer company, merged it with rival EMC Corp., and returned it to the public markets two years ago.

MSD Partners was founded in 2009. The firm has steered clear of technology deals, instead investing mainly in credit and real estate, including the Four Seasons in Hawaii that neighbors Mr. Lemkau's vacation home.

Mr. Lemkau's departure means that for the first time in years Goldman doesn't have an M&A guru running its investment bank.

"Press Release: The Home Depot Announces Third Quarter Results; Plans to Invest Approximately $1 Billion in Annualized Permanent Compensation Enhancements for Frontline, Hourly Associates","ATLANTA, Nov. 17, 2020

ATLANTA, Nov. 17, 2020 /CNW/ -- The Home Depot (R) , the world's largest home improvement retailer, today reported sales of $33.5 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, an increase of $6.3 billion, or 23.2 percent from the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Comparable sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were positive 24.1 percent, and comparable sales in the U.S. were positive 24.6 percent.

Net earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were $3.4 billion, or $3.18 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $2.8 billion, or $2.53 per diluted share, in the same period of fiscal 2019. For the third quarter of fiscal 2020, diluted earnings per share increased 25.7 percent from the same period in the prior year.

""The third quarter was another exceptional quarter for The Home Depot as we saw the continuation of outsized demand for home improvement projects, which has led to sales growth of more than $15 billion through the first nine months of the year,"" said Craig Menear , chairman and CEO. ""Our ability to effectively adapt to this high-demand environment is a testament to both the investments we have made in the business as well as our associates' focus on customers. We continue to lean into these investments because we believe they are critical in enabling market share growth in any economic environment. I am proud of the resilience and strength our associates have continued to demonstrate, and I would like to thank them and our supplier partners,"" said Menear.

Investment in Associates

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, The Home Depot has taken significant actions to support associates, including expanded paid time off for all hourly associates to use at their discretion and the implementation of a temporary weekly bonus program. The Company is now transitioning from these temporary programs to invest in permanent compensation enhancements for frontline, hourly associates. This will result in approximately $1 billion of incremental compensation on an annualized basis.

The Home Depot will conduct a conference call today at 9 a.m. ET to discuss information included in this news release and related matters. The conference call will be available in its entirety through a webcast and replay at ir.homedepot.com/events-and-presentations.

At the end of the third quarter, the Company operated a total of 2,295 retail stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, 10 Canadian provinces and Mexico. The Company employs more than 400,000 associates. The Home Depot 's stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: HD) and is included in the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500 index.

NEW YORK, Nov. 17, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Local startups, universities, large enterprises and the public sector will soon be able to develop and test 5G-enabled solutions at Verizon Business' new 5G Innovation Hub in Lake Nona, a ""living lab"" smart community located in Orlando, FL. The new Innovation Hub will provide an opportunity to test 5G use cases for connected healthcare, autonomous mobility, smart communities, education, retail and others. Created by the Tavistock Group, Lake Nona is home to thousands of residents (known as ""citizen scientists""), students, visitors, national headquarters and leading healthcare facilities and is focused on providing an ideal landscape to create new and innovative experiences across a multitude of industries.

With Verizon 's 5G Ultra Wideband network on site, innovators will be able to test how Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband's super-fast speeds, ultra-high bandwidth and ultra-low latency can enhance applications for industries prevalent in Lake Nona such as connected healthcare and technology, autonomous mobility, smart communities, health and wellness, education, retail and sports.

One of the 5G trials already underway at Lake Nona involves testing Cellular Vehicle-To-Everything (C-V2X) technology with Beep, an Autonomous Mobility-as-a-Service provider. The initial pilot will examine how C-V2X can improve the safety of Beep's autonomous shuttles, which currently operate on several routes throughout the community. The C-V2X pilot involves Verizon 's 4G LTE and 5G Ultra Wideband networks, Multi-Access Edge Compute (MEC), Real Time Kinematics (RTK), and Computer Vision.

""5G is paving the way for unprecedented innovations that will reshape the world and have a massive impact on how we live, work, and play,"" said Sampath Sowmyanarayan, SVP and President of Enterprise at Verizon. ""We're creating Innovation Hubs powered by Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband to serve as launch pads for high-impact, transformational experiences and are excited to see the new 5G use cases that will be developed in Lake Nona.""

The new Innovation Hub will also showcase existing 5G use cases for visitors to experience and includes an Executive Briefing Center that will provide prospects and customers with access to Verizon leadership and subject matter experts. Verizon started deploying its 5G Ultra Wideband network in Lake Nona earlier this year.

""Tavistock is fully committed to the cultivation of 5G technology to usher in a new era of connectivity,"" said Juan Santos, Senior Vice President of Innovation at Tavistock. ""A 5G-enabled future will transform our daily lives in ways we've only just begun to imagine. We're excited to expand our 5G capabilities in Lake Nona and to attract the brightest minds and biggest ideas to the entrepreneurial ecosystem of Orlando.""

This engagement is part of Verizon Business' broader strategy to partner with enterprises, startups, universities, national labs and government/military to explore how 5G can disrupt and transform nearly every industry. Verizon operates six 5G Labs in the U.S. and one in London that specialize in developing uses cases in industries ranging from healthcare to public safety to entertainment. In addition, Verizon is setting up 5G Innovation Hubs on-premise for several customers as part of an ongoing initiative to partner on 5G-related use cases to help customers transform their industries.

Johnson & Johnson commits $100 million over the next five years to invest in and promote health equity solutions

PR Newswire

NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Nov. 17, 2020

NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Nov. 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) announced today $100 million in commitments and collaborations over the next five years to invest in and promote health equity solutions for Black people and other communities of color in the United States. Society has been significantly impacted by systemic racism, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the economic decline throughout this year, which have all spotlighted healthcare inequities.

""There is an urgent need to take on the inequities rooted in systemic racism that threaten health in communities of color across the United States,"" said Alex Gorsky , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Johnson & Johnson. ""That's why Johnson & Johnson is focusing its efforts and committing $100 million to address racial and social injustice as the critical public health issue that it is. As the largest and most broadly-based healthcare company in the world, we are uniquely positioned to convene private, public and community organizations in pursuit of this shared aspiration--and work together to make a meaningful impact through science, business, public health, and philanthropy.""

The Company's commitment prioritizes three key areas: Healthier Communities -- investing in programs that help provide equitable healthcare for underserved communities; Enduring Alliances -- forging partnerships and alliances that combat racial and social health determinants; and Diverse & Inclusive Corporate Culture -- ensuring a diverse and inclusive workforce.

Healthier Communities

""The quality of your healthcare should not be determined by your race and ethnicity,"" said Alex Gorsky . Johnson & Johnson is investing in culturally competent community care solutions that create healthier outcomes for Black people and other communities of color. Several key community programs are immediately underway, and others will be deployed. 


   -- In order to better connect clinical and medical care with social and 
      cultural needs, Johnson & Johnson  is introducing new scholarships, 
      mentoring and non-financial support to improve representation of people 
      of color in medical, scientific, and health professions. 
 
   -- The Company will strengthen community health by providing technology 
      enhancements and mobile health solutions, that put health within reach of 
      underserved and minority populations through partnerships with Community 
      Based Clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers. 
 
   -- Johnson & Johnson  is undertaking a major initiative to increase access 
      and participation in clinical trials in diverse populations. 
 
   -- While health equity efforts will go beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, knowing 
      communities of color have been disproportionally impacted, the Company 
      has funded mobile vans to extend the reach of care in high-need and 
      hard-to-reach areas to support COVID-19 testing, starting with Detroit 
      and New Orleans. Further, the Company is seeking diverse enrollment in 
      the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials to inform the safety and 
      effectiveness of the vaccine. 
 
   -- As a kick-start effort to bring health equity ideas forward directly from 
      those impacted, Johnson & Johnson  will partner with local community 
      leaders, businesses and entrepreneurs in six major cities across America 
      to identify and invest in scalable and sustainable healthcare solutions 
      that have the potential to create a positive impact for communities of 
      color. 

Enduring Alliances

""Our 130+ year history in healthcare, science and technology gives us access to a global network that we will activate and inspire to join us in influencing systemic change that positively impacts the quality of healthcare for Black people and other communities of color,"" said Michael Sneed , Executive Vice President, Global Corporate Affairs & Chief Communications Officer, Johnson & Johnson.

Johnson & Johnson is leveraging its global network to also address social, environmental, and economic determinants related to health inequities. The Company is partnering with universities, health systems, NGOs and governments to build breakthrough coalitions to develop and expand economic, education and social programs that close the health disparity divide. 


   -- Starting in 2021, the Company will introduce alliances, collaborations 
      and partnerships that support health equity solutions and educational 
      programming ranging from maternal health resources to inspiring black 
      students to pursue science and health careers. 
 
   -- Johnson & Johnson  is partnering with The Executive Leadership Council to 
      provide college scholarships and other resources to Black students who 
      have a passion for STEM, business, or healthcare-related fields. 
 
   -- The Company will invest in partnerships that address the disproportionate 
      health impact of climate change on communities of color. 

In addition to its commitment to health equity, through the Johnson & Johnson Supply Chain, the Company is also proud to commit several hundred million in annual spend with Black and Hispanic owned businesses over the next five years to drive positive social and economic impact.

Diverse & Inclusive Corporate Culture

""Our long-standing commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion gives us the foundation to drive sustainable change. We are accelerating and expanding our efforts to strengthen our inclusive culture and build a workforce that reflects the diversity of the patients and communities we serve."" said Wanda Hope, Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer, Johnson & Johnson.

Internally, Johnson & Johnson remains focused on cultivating a diverse and inclusive workforce that inspires innovative healthcare solutions around the world. 


   -- The Company is committed to hiring more diverse employees and has set a 
      goal of achieving 50% growth of its African American talent at the 
      manager and above levels in the U.S. over the next five years. 
 
   -- Johnson & Johnson  is also enhancing HR processes to optimize how it 
      accesses, hires, and develops talent, and is offering cultural immersion 
      programs to enhance awareness and understanding. 

Johnson & Johnson will make multi-million-dollar investments in Healthier Communities and Enduring Alliances programs, while the investment made in its Diverse & Inclusive Corporate Culture will largely focus on enhancing processes, training, and education. Although this announcement represents immediate action, Johnson & Johnson 's commitment to address racial and social injustice is enduring.

Press Release: GoDaddy Launches GoDaddy Corporate Domains,"PR Newswire

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov. 17, 2020

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov. 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- GoDaddy Inc . (NYSE: GDDY), the world's largest domain name registrar, today announced the launch of GoDaddy Corporate Domains, a domain management solution for large companies. The launch builds off of GoDaddy's acquisition of Brandsight in February 2020.

Typically, companies register domain names in support of product launches, marketing campaigns, international expansion and to protect their intellectual property. It's not uncommon for large organizations to have thousands, or even tens of thousands of domain names. As a result, these large portfolios often contain domains that are not resolving, are misconfigured, or are no longer needed. Additionally, domains are often registered across multiple registrars, making it even more difficult to gain visibility into how domain names are being used.

""Corporate domain portfolios can't use traditional domain management tools. They need a solution that provides access to unique data to enable informed decisions, like identifying which domains are essential and which can be allowed to lapse. That's why we created GoDaddy Corporate Domains,"" said Roger Chen, GoDaddy President, Domain Registrars and Investors. ""The superior technology we offer provides valuable insights quickly, which is complemented by world-class support. Combining Brandsight's platform with GoDaddy's immense reach and resources, we've set a new benchmark for enterprise-grade corporate domain solutions.""

Providing services to some of the world's most well-known brands, GoDaddy Corporate Domains is focused on enabling companies to contain costs, optimize portfolios and mitigate risks by providing unprecedented access to domain name and website data. GoDaddy Corporate Domains clients also benefit from streamlined workflows, powerful reporting, and advanced security solutions.

GoDaddy Corporate Domains provides a full suite of services including domain name strategy development and portfolio rightsizing. If a business needs help, they can contact their dedicated client success manager to provide guidance or assist with day-to-day management of the portfolio.

""While our clients look different from traditional GoDaddy customers, the same philosophy applies,"" said Elisa Cooper , Head of Marketing & Product at GoDaddy Corporate Domains. ""We provide them with intuitive products that incorporate the latest technology and combine it with high-touch, personalized care to help them achieve their goals.""

GoDaddy today also launched the GoDaddy Verified Intellectual Property (VIP) program. The VIP program provides pre-vetted, well-known and famous brands an escalation path to address IP abuse. It covers fraudulent domains registrations, infringing websites hosted with GoDaddy, among other forms of abuse. This program is currently invitation-only.

Walmart’s Sales Gains Slow as Pandemic Drags On,"In the U.S., shopper traffic decreased 14.2%, while the value of the average shopping trip increased 24%. People are making fewer trips to Walmart stores, shifting more spending online and stocking up when they do go to stores, the company said. Sales of groceries, paper goods and household cleaning supplies helped boost sales. Demand for parking lot pickup services or home delivery increased.

“We think these new customer behaviors will largely persist and we’re well positioned to serve customers with the value and experience they’re looking for,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said.

Coronavirus has upended the retail landscape, allowing some retailers to thrive as more spending shifts to household basics and home improvements. Others such as department stores and apparel retailers have been hurt by temporary closures early in the pandemic and people buying less clothes for work or going out.

On Tuesday, Home Depot Inc. said its comparable sales jumped 24.1% in the third quarter, after reporting sales up 23.4% in the second quarter. Shoppers stuck at home are using money typically spent on restaurants or travel to spruce up their surroundings. Competitor Lowe’s Cos. reports earnings Wednesday.

Shares of Walmart rose 2% in premarket trading while Home Depot fell nearly 2%. Both shares have climbed more than 25% so far this year.

"Business News: BBVA, Exiting U.S., Discusses Merger With Spanish Bank","Instead, BBVA signaled it will use the sale proceeds to increase its presence at home and in other core markets to scale up and boost profit. On Monday, following the U.S. sale announcement, BBVA said it was in merger talks with domestic peer Banco de Sabadell SA.

BBVA's strategic shake-up shows how the coronavirus pandemic is forcing European banks to be more calculated about their prospects for growth and survival. Another duo of Spanish lenders, CaixaBank SA and Bankia SA, agreed to merge in September, and analysts and regulators are betting more deals will come.

With the cash proceeds from the PNC deal -- equating to 50% of BBVA's entire market value -- the bank could buy Sabadell and still have money left to buy back shares to boost its share price and satisfy shareholders. Sabadell's shares, which have been hit along with the share of other European banks, are down some 60% this year.

Shares of BBVA closed Monday up 15% in Madrid. Sabadell's rose almost 25% before BBVA made its announcement after the European market close.

BBVA was among the European banks that spread out across the world before the last financial crisis on a hunt for growth. It bought a small California bank in 2004 and expanded across Texas, Arizona and other Sun Belt states through a string of acquisitions. It and larger Spanish rival Banco Santander SA kept sizable retail banks in both North and South America, even after other foreign banks exited in recent years.

While BBVA was the No. 4 bank in Texas by deposits, its market share, at 4.5%, was considered too small for strong returns.

Pittsburgh-based PNC said it agreed to buy BBVA's U.S. operations for $11.6 billion. In the U.S., shares of PNC closed up 2.9% at $126.29. Big bank takeovers have been rare since the 2008 crisis, with major players unwilling to test the political waters and wary of new regulations now applied to larger banks. Democratic administrations have typically been less friendly toward megabank deals.

Still, PNC is confident it will receive approval for BBVA, which had been at ""the top, or near top, of our wish list,"" PNC Chief Executive Bill Demchak said on a call with investors Monday, in part because the combined entity will be ""one-fifth the size of the giant four banks out there."" The combined PNC-BBVA will have assets of about $550 billion. JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest bank in the U.S., has more than $3 trillion.

Other geographic retreats by European banks so far this year have included HSBC Holdings PLC's closing around one-third of its U.S. branches.","[55.32, 56.95, 57.33, 57.0, 59.46, 60.94, 60.43, 60.18, 59.75, 60.82, 60.62, 58.96, 59.3, 59.8, 59.58, 59.47, 59.7, 59.68, 58.83, 59.56, 59.51, 60.59, 60.89, 61.15, 61.46, 60.97, 60.96, 60.52, 60.29, 59.62, 59.75, 59.67, 59.69, 59.9, 57.49, 57.08, 55.59, 56.02, 56.11, 56.45, 56.8, 56.49, 56.66, 56.8, 56.84, 56.67, 57.2, 56.45, 56.91, 57.15]","[56.25, 56.45, 55.7, 56.08, 57.57, 57.41, 57.76, 57.72, 58.74, 59.08]"
Walmart Sales Rise But Pace Eases Up -- WSJ,"Comparable U.S. sales, those at stores or digital channels operating for at least 12 months, rose 6.4% in the quarter ended in late October. It was a third consecutive quarter of strong growth, though below the prior two quarters. E-commerce sales in the U.S. jumped 79% and accounted for much of the latest quarter's gains.

In the U.S., shopper traffic decreased 14.2%, while the value of the average shopping trip increased 24%. People are making fewer trips to Walmart stores, shifting more spending online and stocking up when they do go to stores, the company said. Sales of groceries, paper goods and household cleaning supplies helped boost sales. Demand for parking-lot pickup services or home delivery increased.

""When the pandemic hit, we were hit hard from an out-of-stock standpoint and it sent traffic into other retailers,"" Walmart finance chief Brett Biggs said in an interview. In-stock levels have since improved, he said. ""Over time that works its way back, as people get back to what the new normal looks like.""

Coronavirus has upended the retail landscape, allowing some retailers to thrive as more spending shifts to household basics and home improvements. Others such as department stores and apparel retailers have been hurt by temporary closures early in the pandemic and people buying less clothing for work or going out.

""Changes in customer behavior have accelerated the shift to e-commerce and digital. We were well positioned to catch and ride these waves given our previous work and investments,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on a call Tuesday.

The Commerce Department on Tuesday said U.S. retail sales increased a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in October from a month earlier. It was the sixth straight month of gains but the pace of growth slowed. Stimulus funds ran out for many unemployed Americans.

On Tuesday, Home Depot Inc. said its comparable sales jumped 24% in the third quarter, but higher costs depressed profit. Shoppers stuck at home are using money typically spent on restaurants or travel to spruce up their surroundings. Competitor Lowe's Cos. reports earnings Wednesday.

Kohl's Corp., a department store chain, reported its comparable store and online sales fell 13% in the third quarter. The sales drop was less severe than the second quarter and Kohl's said it would reinstitute its cash dividend in 2021. Macy's Inc. reports results Thursday.

Shares of Walmart slipped 2% Tuesday while Home Depot fell 2.5%. Both shares have climbed around 25% so far this year. Kohl's shares, down about 40% on the year, gained almost 12% Tuesday.

""Within Walmart's results are some mixed trends,"" said John Zolidis, president and retail analyst at Quo Vadis Capital. ""Clearly commerce has accelerated, but we can also see traffic was down 14% for the second consecutive quarter and that's a big number.""

Mr. Zolidis gave Walmart a ""sell"" rating last month, saying that it will be hard for the retailer to upstage its current results next year.

Walmart executives said foot traffic and grocery market share are improving as it extends its stores' hours and improves its in-stock levels. Early in the pandemic, Walmart reduced hours, often closing at 8:30 p.m., instead of staying open 24 hours a day, to give workers more time to clean and stock shelves. In recent weeks it extended opening hours to 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. in most stores and plans to add back more hours, executives said on the conference call Tuesday.

Walmart's traffic is falling more than some competitors because most rivals weren't open 24 hours a day before the pandemic. ""That comparison will be really different than our competitors who don't stay open 24 hours a day,"" Mr. Biggs, the CFO, said.

""While it's still early in the quarter, with big sales days in front of us, we expect it to be a good holiday season,"" Mr. Biggs said.

Walmart has tried to ramp up its online offerings by rolling out grocery pickup and delivery services at more than half its 4,700 U.S. stores. It has also introduced the Walmart+ membership program that gives free delivery for a $98 annual fee. The company didn't say how many people have signed up for the service.

The company has also invested in e-commerce operations in the U.S., adding marketplace services and expanding its own selection to compete with Amazon.com Inc. In its September quarter, Amazon's revenue soared 37% to a record $96.2 billion and its profit tripled to $6.3 billion, propelled by both online shopping and its lucrative cloud-computing arm.

While Walmart still is larger in terms of total revenue, Amazon's profit eclipsed Walmart's haul in the latest period. On Tuesday, Amazon moved further into Walmart's turf with an online pharmacy service.

Walmart reported total revenue of $134.71 billion for the quarter ended Oct. 31, up 5.2% from the year ago quarter. It had a profit of $5.14 billion, compared with $3.29 billion last year.

The latest period included $400 million in additional Covid-related expenses, a loss on the Argentina unit sale and a gain on the value of its stake in China's JD.com. The retailer has been pruning its bricks-and-mortar locations in slower-growth countries outside the U.S. During the latest quarter, Walmart agreed to sell its Asda chain in the U.K. and its stores in Argentina. This week, it struck a deal to sell its stores in Japan -- 18 years after entering the island country.

Mr. McMillon congratulated President-elect Biden on the company's earnings call Tuesday. ""We look forward to working with the administration in both houses of Congress to move the country forward,"" the Walmart CEO said. Days after the election Mr. McMillon also supported the results through his role as head of Business Roundtable.

Commercial air travel is down 75% since the onset of the pandemic.

And the arrival of the vaccine means that people may actually have the opportunity to fly Boeing's 737 MAX in a matter of weeks, if they choose to do so. Boeing stock has gained nearly 6%.

But think about this: The 737 Max was grounded on March 13, 2019, and it's taken Boeing 20 months to get it recertified to fly again. Pfizer and BioNTech announced their plans to co-develop a vaccine eight months ago on March 17 of this year.

Daily Coronavirus Death Count Hits Global Record as Winter Approaches

The number of daily reported deaths attributed to Covid-19 infections worldwide rose to 10,816 on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally. This is the highest number since Nov. 4, dampening recent optimism about the efficacy of vaccines currently in the final stages of testing. 


   -- Britain, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson is isolating for two weeks 
      after meeting a member of Parliament who tested positive, reported 598 
      deaths on Tuesday, the highest daily number since May. 
 
   -- French officials said that there had been 46,273 coronavirus fatalities 
      in the country as of Tuesday since the beginning of the pandemic. In 
      Europe, only the U.K., 52,745, and Italy, with 48,464, had a higher death 
      count. 
 
   -- In the United States, the worst-affected country globally with a fifth of 
      known infections worldwide, nearly 249,000 people have died from the 
      virus. 

What's Next: Governments who had devised huge fiscal stimulus plans to tackle the first wave of the pandemic are yet to decide what to do about the second one, even though recent vaccine news show the virus could be vanquished next year. Meanwhile the temporary lockdowns implemented throughout Europe are likely to be extended.

Twitter Launches New Feature as Congress Grills CEO Dorsey

Twitter launched a new feature called Fleets the same day CEO Jack Dorsey testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. 


   -- Fleets allow users to post messages, photos, and videos that disappear 
      after 24 hours. The feature is akin to stories, which are popular on 
      Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram. 
 
   -- The social media company also teased a new audio chat feature called 
      ""Spaces."" A Twitter spokesperson told Barron's, ""Audio is another way for 
      people to share what's on their minds with their own voice and we see 
      this opening doors to a more collaborative experience."" 
 
   -- Also on Tuesday, Dorsey and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg were grilled by 
      lawmakers about their content moderation process. Though senators on both 
      sides of the aisle have concerns about Twitter and Facebook, Republicans 
      believe the sites censor conservative voices and Democrats argue the 
      platforms don't do enough to curb hate speech and misinformation. 

What's Next: The Verge reported Twitter will begin tests for the audio service this year, and plans to prioritize first access to people who are most affected by harassment on the platform: women and people from marginalized communities.

Trump Fires Top Cybersecurity Expert; Biden Names White House Aides

Pledging to build an administration that ""looks like America,"" President-elect Joe Biden announced several senior White House aides Tuesday. Several hours later, President Donald Trump fired his top cybersecurity official, Christopher Krebs, who had pushed back against Trump's claims of a rigged election. 


   -- Most of Biden's appointees have long been in his inner circle, including 
      Mike Donilon, a career political strategist who will serve as senior 
      advisor to the president-elect. He was previously the chief strategist 
      for the Biden-Harris campaign and has worked on several previous 
      presidential campaigns. 
 
   -- Cedric Richmond, currently a Congress member from Louisiana representing 
      the New Orleans area and a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, 
      will be senior advisor to the president and director of the White House 
      Office of Public Engagement. The appointment makes him the 
      highest-ranking Black aide to Biden. 
 
   -- Roger Ferguson, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve and current 
      CEO of Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, announced 
      his resignation effective March 31, leading to speculation that he might 
      be nominated as Biden's Treasury secretary. 
 
   -- Several of Biden's other appointees are women, including Julie 
      Chávez Rodriguez, granddaughter of labor leader César 
      Chávez, who will serve as director of the White House Office of 
      Intergovernmental Affairs. 
 
   -- Last week, Biden tapped Ron Klain as his chief of staff. Klain, a 
      political consultant, previously served as chief of staff to both Al Gore 
      and Biden when each was vice president. 

What's Next: Biden is expected to name his cabinet nominees in the coming days. Meanwhile, Trump has not conceded he lost the election and has not allowed Biden to receive briefings that a president-elect normally would.

   -- The Wall Street Journal reported that with two Republicans in the Senate 
      sidelined due to Covid-19 precautions, Senate Majority Leader Mitch 
      McConnell did not have a majority he needed to push forward Shelton's 
      confirmation. 
 
   -- Shelton, who was picked by President Donald Trump, has expressed views 
      that differ from mainstream economists. She's advocated bringing back the 
      gold standard, and is against federal deposit insurance. 
 
   -- Republican Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Mitt Romney of Utah, and 
      Susan Collins of Maine have said they wouldn't support Shelton's 
      confirmation. Sens. Rick Scott of Florida and Chuck Grassley of Iowa were 
      in quarantine Tuesday. 

What's Next: The Journal noted McConnell changed his vote to ""no,"" which will enable him to bring the matter back before lawmakers leave for Thanksgiving. Even if Shelton joins the board, it's unlikely she alone would shift monetary policy.

Amazon Bigfoots Its Way Into the Online Pharmacy Business

The world's largest online retailer unveiled Amazon Pharmacy Tuesday, with free two-day delivery of prescriptions to Amazon Prime members plus discounts for uninsured customers. 


   -- Amazon first entered the pharmacy business in 2018, when it bought the 
      New Hampshire-based online pharmacy PillPack. 
 
   -- CVS and Walgreens already offer free shipping and discount cards. 
      Nonetheless, shares of Walgreens sunk nearly 10% on the news Tuesday, 
      while CVS stock dropped nearly 9%. 
 
   -- Investors are overreacting. Mail-order represents just a fifth of 
      prescription drug sales, and CVS and Walgreens are focusing more on their 
      in-store services, such as staffing stores with medical professionals. 
 
   -- UBS analyst Eric Sheridan sees Amazon's move as a way to add value to its 
      Prime membership program and capture more of its members' spending. 

What's Next: A bigger loser may actually be GoodRx, a drug discount card company that went public in September. That's because Amazon is offering Prime members its own discount program through Cigna's InsideRx.

Dear Moneyist,

I recently decided to leave my job, and start my own business. The success of that business propelled me to go into a new one with a partner and we are both doing very well financially.

My issue lies within my friend group. I'm 27 years old and my friends make nowhere near the type of money I do. Before making this type of money I was always a generous friend.

I would treat them when we went out for drinks or dinner and, if a friend ever needed extra cash, I always had money to spare to help them out.

Now that I'm a business owner and learning more about money management, I haven't been willing to do as much lavish spending, or compensate my friends anymore.

This has made some of them angry. These are long-term friends, and I don't want to lose them. But at the end of day I'm nobody's bank or ATM, and they shouldn't always depend on me.

Is there a way of going about this without offending them, or losing these friendships?

"Pfizer's Covid Vaccine, Boeing's 737 MAX, and Signs of Life Returning to Normal -- Barrons.com","Having a vaccine is great news for everyone, but it's particularly good news for Boeing and the commercial aerospace industry, which has been decimated by Covid-19. Commercial air travel is down 75% since the onset of the pandemic.

And the arrival of the vaccine means that people may actually have the opportunity to fly Boeing's 737 MAX in a matter of weeks, if they choose to do so. Boeing stock has gained nearly 6%.

But think about this: The 737 Max was grounded on March 13, 2019, and it's taken Boeing 20 months to get it recertified to fly again. Pfizer and BioNTech announced their plans to co-develop a vaccine eight months ago on March 17 of this year.

Now that's ingenuity at work.

Daily Coronavirus Death Count Hits Global Record as Winter Approaches

The number of daily reported deaths attributed to Covid-19 infections worldwide rose to 10,816 on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally. This is the highest number since Nov. 4, dampening recent optimism about the efficacy of vaccines currently in the final stages of testing. 


   -- Britain, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson is isolating for two weeks 
      after meeting a member of Parliament who tested positive, reported 598 
      deaths on Tuesday, the highest daily number since May. 
 
   -- French officials said that there had been 46,273 coronavirus fatalities 
      in the country as of Tuesday since the beginning of the pandemic. In 
      Europe, only the U.K., 52,745, and Italy, with 48,464, had a higher death 
      count. 
 
   -- In the United States, the worst-affected country globally with a fifth of 
      known infections worldwide, nearly 249,000 people have died from the 
      virus. 

What's Next: Governments who had devised huge fiscal stimulus plans to tackle the first wave of the pandemic are yet to decide what to do about the second one, even though recent vaccine news show the virus could be vanquished next year. Meanwhile the temporary lockdowns implemented throughout Europe are likely to be extended.

Twitter Launches New Feature as Congress Grills CEO Dorsey

Twitter launched a new feature called Fleets the same day CEO Jack Dorsey testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. 


   -- Fleets allow users to post messages, photos, and videos that disappear 
      after 24 hours. The feature is akin to stories, which are popular on 
      Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram. 
 
   -- The social media company also teased a new audio chat feature called 
      ""Spaces."" A Twitter spokesperson told Barron's, ""Audio is another way for 
      people to share what's on their minds with their own voice and we see 
      this opening doors to a more collaborative experience."" 
 
   -- Also on Tuesday, Dorsey and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg were grilled by 
      lawmakers about their content moderation process. Though senators on both 
      sides of the aisle have concerns about Twitter and Facebook, Republicans 
      believe the sites censor conservative voices and Democrats argue the 
      platforms don't do enough to curb hate speech and misinformation. 

What's Next: The Verge reported Twitter will begin tests for the audio service this year, and plans to prioritize first access to people who are most affected by harassment on the platform: women and people from marginalized communities.

Trump Fires Top Cybersecurity Expert; Biden Names White House Aides

Pledging to build an administration that ""looks like America,"" President-elect Joe Biden announced several senior White House aides Tuesday. Several hours later, President Donald Trump fired his top cybersecurity official, Christopher Krebs, who had pushed back against Trump's claims of a rigged election. 


   -- Most of Biden's appointees have long been in his inner circle, including 
      Mike Donilon, a career political strategist who will serve as senior 
      advisor to the president-elect. He was previously the chief strategist 
      for the Biden-Harris campaign and has worked on several previous 
      presidential campaigns. 
 
   -- Cedric Richmond, currently a Congress member from Louisiana representing 
      the New Orleans area and a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, 
      will be senior advisor to the president and director of the White House 
      Office of Public Engagement. The appointment makes him the 
      highest-ranking Black aide to Biden. 
 
   -- Roger Ferguson, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve and current 
      CEO of Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, announced 
      his resignation effective March 31, leading to speculation that he might 
      be nominated as Biden's Treasury secretary. 
 
   -- Several of Biden's other appointees are women, including Julie 
      Chávez Rodriguez, granddaughter of labor leader César 
      Chávez, who will serve as director of the White House Office of 
      Intergovernmental Affairs. 
 
   -- Last week, Biden tapped Ron Klain as his chief of staff. Klain, a 
      political consultant, previously served as chief of staff to both Al Gore 
      and Biden when each was vice president. 

What's Next: Biden is expected to name his cabinet nominees in the coming days. Meanwhile, Trump has not conceded he lost the election and has not allowed Biden to receive briefings that a president-elect normally would.

Press Release: Polygiene and world leading Caterpillar in exciting partnership,"STOCKHOLM, Nov. 18, 2020

STOCKHOLM, Nov. 18, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Caterpillar (R) is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment. It has grown to become one of the highest valued brands in the world*, making workwear and casualwear that embodies their essence of getting the work done. Now Polygiene and CAT(R) has started a partnership to protect clothes from bacteria and other microbes - to reduce the need of washing and by that prolonging the active life of the garment. The partnership starts in the casual wear collection, ramping up for 2021 and beyond.

""CAT has a vision of a world in which people's basic needs - such as shelter, clean water, education and reliable energy - are fulfilled. At first, we saw it just as a neat idea to protect garments against microbes and bacteria, but when we understood it will drastically reduce the ecological footprint as people can wash far less, we saw the fit"", says Greg Gemette, Senior Vice President at Caterpillar Apparel.

""CAT is one of those brands that everyone knows, and I am looking forward to a successful partnership"", says Ulrika Björk , CEO Polygiene. ""Whether we talk causal wear or later the workwear, I am convinced that the added value of Polygiene will make a big difference for the end consumer, especially during these tough times.

*Boeing Responds to FAA Approval to Resume 737 MAX Ops,"PR Newswire

SEATTLE, Nov. 18, 2020

SEATTLE, Nov. 18, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) today rescinded the order that halted commercial operations of Boeing (NYSE: BA) 737-8s and 737-9s. The move will allow airlines that are under the FAA 's jurisdiction, including those in the U.S., to take the steps necessary to resume service and Boeing to begin making deliveries.

""We will never forget the lives lost in the two tragic accidents that led to the decision to suspend operations,"" said David Calhoun , chief executive officer of The Boeing Company. ""These events and the lessons we have learned as a result have reshaped our company and further focused our attention on our core values of safety, quality and integrity.""

Throughout the past 20 months, Boeing has worked closely with airlines, providing them with detailed recommendations regarding long-term storage and ensuring their input was part of the effort to safely return the airplanes to service.

An Airworthiness Directive issued by the FAA spells out the requirements that must be met before U.S. carriers can resume service, including installing software enhancements, completing wire separation modifications, conducting pilot training and accomplishing thorough de-preservation activities that will ensure the airplanes are ready for service.

""The FAA 's directive is an important milestone,"" said Stan Deal, president and chief executive officer of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. ""We will continue to work with regulators around the world and our customers to return the airplane back into service worldwide.""

In addition to changes made to the airplane and pilot training, Boeing has taken three important steps to strengthen its focus on safety and quality. 


   1. Organizational Alignment: More than 50,000 engineers have been brought 
      together in a single organization that includes a new Product & Services 
      Safety unit, unifying safety responsibilities across the company. 
 
   2. Cultural Focus: Engineers have been further empowered to improve safety 
      and quality. The company is identifying, diagnosing and resolving issues 
      with a higher level of transparency and immediacy. 
 
   3. Process Enhancements: By adopting next-generation design processes, the 
      company is enabling greater levels of first-time quality.

The resulting 95% effectiveness rate puts the shot’s performance on par with shingles and measles vaccines. It is also consistent with the vaccine’s showing in a peek last week at how it did in an analysis of the first 94 subjects to fall sick.

Researchers haven’t found any serious safety issues, the companies said. The vaccine appeared to be well tolerated following a review of data from 8,000 study subjects, the companies said.

A severe side effect was fatigue, reported by 3.8% of the subjects, the companies said. Also, 2% of subjects reported headaches.

The companies said they have collected the two months of safety data on about 19,000 study subjects requested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration but are still reviewing all those results.

“The study results mark an important step in this historic eight-month journey to bring forward a vaccine capable of helping to end this devastating pandemic,” Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said. “We continue to move at the speed of science to compile all the data collected thus far and share with regulators around the world.”

The company is waiting to fully analyze the data and compile required documentation before asking for authorization, a spokeswoman said.

Days earlier, Moderna Inc. reported similarly strong preliminary results for its shot, which the biotech said was 94.5% effective in an early look.

The accumulation of positive data for the two shots suggests that drugmakers can develop vaccines capable of protecting against infections causing Covid-19 and its symptoms and that life could return to normal if sufficient numbers of people get inoculated.

Surveys show, however, that large percentages of people are hesitant to get the shots, partly out of concern the vaccines wouldn’t be safe because their development was rushed.

Drugmakers and health regulators have said they wouldn’t allow a vaccine to go into use unless it is proven to work safely. If it shows to be without severe side effects in the final analysis, the Pfizer vaccine’s safety data might help governments make the case for getting vaccinated.

Moderna, which is using the same kind of gene-based technology as Pfizer and BioNTech in its shot, is expected to report its safety data later this month.

Both shots work by delivering molecules, known as messenger RNA, that teach cells to make something resembling the spike protein that juts from the surface of the new coronavirus. Exposure to the protein preps a vaccinated person’s immune system to fight off the virus.

In their late-stage, or Phase 3, trial, New York-based Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech directed that half the subjects receive the vaccine while the rest take a placebo.

Then the companies waited for enough volunteers to get exposed to the virus. They enrolled tens of thousands of subjects to increase the odds that some would develop Covid-19 with at least one symptom, though researchers needed only a fraction to assess using standard statistical methods whether the vaccine works safely.

The FDA required vaccine makers to monitor subjects for two months after their inoculation was completed because serious side effects usually crop up within roughly six weeks. The agency also wanted to see whether a vaccine was at least 50% effective.

For the final analysis of their Phase 3 trial results, the companies planned to wait for 164 study subjects to become infected and develop at least one symptom. Fifty-three of the sick subjects would need to have received the vaccine, with the rest getting the placebo, to be 52% effective, according to Pfizer’s trial protocol.

By the time the final analysis occurred, researchers recorded several additional cases, bringing the total number of sickened subjects to 170. Researchers looked at how well the shots worked seven days after a study volunteer got a second dose.

The infected subjects included 10 severe cases of Covid-19, with nine in the placebo group and one in the vaccine group.

The vaccine was effective across different ages, races and ethnic groups, and it was more than 94% effective in adults over 65 years old, the companies said.

About 42% of the trial participants are from racial or ethnic minority groups, while 41% are ages 56 to 85, the companies said.

A committee of independent health experts analyzed the data from the trial, then reported the results to Pfizer and BioNTech. The companies released the data by press release and plan to publish the results in more detail later in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

Still unknown, as expected, is how long the protection provided by the shot lasts. To make such an assessment, Pfizer plans to monitor study subjects for two years.

Also uncertain is whether the shots work safely in children, since the results are only for volunteers 18 years and older. Pfizer has expanded its trial to include children as young as 12.

The FDA is expected to take some time to consider requests for permission to distribute Covid-19 vaccines. One of the first steps will involve review by an outside committee of vaccine experts.

The FDA plans to conduct its review more quickly than it normally would because of the urgent need for the shots. If the agency finds the vaccines work safely, it will issue what it calls an authorization for emergency use, which the FDA invokes in pandemics.

During the current pandemic, the FDA has authorized for emergency use several drugs, including the antiviral remdesivir from Gilead Sciences Inc. and recently a Covid-19 antibody drug from Eli Lilly & Co.

Upon authorization, Pfizer plans to produce up to 50 million doses by the end of year, about half of which would be destined for the U.S. The supplies would be enough to inoculate only 12.5 million Americans because each person needs to take two doses three weeks apart.

Last summer, the U.S. agreed to pay Pfizer and BioNTech nearly $2 billion after it receives 100 million doses of their vaccine to provide to U.S. patients free of charge. The companies have struck similar supply agreements with other countries and are assembling a vast distribution network to begin shipping them, should regulators sign off.

The vaccine must be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, equivalent to minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit, which prompted Pfizer to create a special container to keep the shots cold during distribution and set up its own supply chain to ferry them around the globe.

The need for ultracold storage has also sent some health authorities and hospitals racing to find special freezers.

In the U.S., health officials are completing the plans for rolling out the vaccines. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a group of external medical experts that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will vote on who should get initial doses. Health experts expect they will go to doctors and nurses treating Covid-19 patients.

A National Academy of Medicine panel recommended that next in line should be people whose health conditions put them at high risk of developing severe Covid-19, elderly people in nursing homes and people in prison. The panel said teachers and transportation workers should follow.

Health authorities expect that the general public could get vaccinated in the spring or summer.

Ronny Gal, a pharmaceutical analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., forecast in a research note Tuesday that vaccination in the U.S. would occur quickly and the country would achieve what is known as herd immunity, which would protect even the unvaccinated from the virus, by June.

Vaccine hesitancy would decline partly due to highly effective vaccines, Mr. Gal said.

Experimental vaccines from Johnson & Johnson and British drugmaker AstraZeneca PLC are also in Phase 3 testing, though results haven’t come out yet. Novavax Inc. expects to begin late-stage testing of its vaccine in the U.S. and Mexico by the end of this month.

Vaccines developed in China and Russia are in use in certain countries.

"Pfizer Says Vaccine Is 95% Effective in Final Data, to Seek Approval in Days","Out of 170 adult volunteers in the nearly 44,000-subject trial who developed Covid-19 with at least one symptom, 162 received a placebo, while eight got the vaccine, Pfizer and BioNTech said.

The resulting 95% effectiveness rate puts the shot’s performance on par with shingles and measles vaccines. It is also consistent with the vaccine’s showing in a peek last week at how it did in an analysis of the first 94 subjects to fall sick.

Researchers haven’t found any serious safety issues, the companies said. The vaccine appeared to be well tolerated following a review of data from 8,000 study subjects, the companies said.
